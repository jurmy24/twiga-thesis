        "page_content": "#### Primary activities:  \nPrimary activities are done by people when they interact directly with the natural environment to obtain their essential needs. These activities include agriculture, forestry, mining, and fishing.  \n##### Agriculture:  \nAgriculture is an activity which involves crop cultivation and livestock-keeping. It is the oldest human activity which has been practised by all societies in the world. It provides food for households and raw materials for industries. The type of agriculture practised in a given place is determined by various conditions of the area including climate, water availability, soil characteristics and terrain. It is also influenced by financial resources, infrastructure, technology and conditions of the market.  \nAgriculture can be done by individual farmers, companies, or co-operative societies. Crop farming is the type of agriculture that involves the cultivation of land to produce crops. Crop farming can be practised to produce food crops and cash crops.  \nFood crops include rice, beans, cassava, maize, wheat, bananas, and potatoes whereas cash crops include sisal, coffee, tea, and cashew-nuts. Figure 1.1 shows a rice paddy.  \nFigure 1.1 Rice paddy  \nSource: Mwakalinga 03 June 2016: ippmedia.com  \nBesides crop farming, there is also livestock-keeping with animals domesticated or kept for meat, milk, wool, skins, and hides. These domesticated animals include cattle, goats, and sheep. Livestock-keeping is widely practiced in Shinyanga, Mwanza, Mara, and Arusha regions. Other regions famous for livestock-keeping include Kagera, Dodoma, Singida, and Tabora. Ranching or commercial livestock-keeping is largely carried out by companies in Tanga, Iringa, Njombe, Kilimanjaro, Dodoma, Singida, and Tabora.  \nFigure 1.2 Herd of Ankole cattle found in Kagera  \nSource: http://ilovekageratanzania.blogspot.com  \n##### Mining:  \nMining is the process of extracting minerals from the crust of the Earth. Mining is done on both small and large scales. Large-scale mining is done by companies using advanced technology and heavy equipment whereas small-scale mining is done by individuals who are known as artisanal miners using simple tools. Some of the minerals found in Tanzania include tanzanite, diamond, gold, coal, uranium, limestone, gemstones, salt, copper, and gypsum. Figure 1.3 shows small-scale miners engaged in a mining activity.  \nFigure 1.3 Small-scale miners using simple tools in Tanzania  \nSource: https://www.dailynews.co.tz/news/2019-02-195c6bb0690c91b.aspx  \n##### Fishing:  \nFishing involves catching fish and other water creatures from oceans, lakes, seas, dams, rivers, and ponds for domestic or commercial purposes. In Tanzania, fishing is done in the Indian Ocean and in lakes such as Victoria, Tanganyika, Rukwa, and Nyasa. There is also fishing in rivers such as Ruvu, Kilombero, and Rufiji. Fishing activities also take place in dams such as Mtera and Nyumba ya Mungu. Major fishing areas in the world are found in Norway, Namibia, Japan, and Sweden.  \nSmall-scale fishing relies on traditional methods such as the use of fish-nets or fish lines and hooks. Figure 1.4 shows small-scale fishing in the Indian ocean. Large-scale fishing is conducted in deep waters of the large seas and oceans where modern fishing methods such as fishing trawlers are used.  \n##### Forestry:  \nForestry is a set of practices that involve managing forests for ecological, social, and economic purposes. There are two types of forests: natural and man-made (planted) forests.  \n##### Planted forests:  \nPlanted forests are those in which trees are planted by human beings. They are commonly known as grown trees. The trees may be obtained locally or from other countries. In Tanzania, mahogany and teak are examples of local species whereas pines and eucalyptus are species from other countries. Some examples of planted forests in Tanzania include The Sao Hill forest plantation in Mafinga, Iringa Region and The West Kilimanjaro forest plantation in Kilimanjaro Region.",

These activities involve the provision of specialized services required for primary and secondary activities. Such activities include transport and communication, trading, administration, banking, and insurance.  \n##### Transport and communication  \nTransportation is the action or process of moving people, goods, and services from one place to another. This may be done by road, railway, air, pipeline, and water. Likewise, communication is the exchange of information between and among different people. Major means of communication include radio, television, newspapers, telephone, and the internet.  \n##### Tourism  \nTourism is the movement of people within a country or from one country to another for the purpose of leisure, pleasure, studies, or trade. Tourism involves traveling to and staying in places outside the usual residence for a certain period. Tourists travel to see the beauty of wildlife, landscape, and man-made features. These features include wildlife conservation areas such as national parks and game reserves, beaches, and historic (heritage) and cultural sites. Beaches in Tanzania are found along the coast of the Indian Ocean and on shores of lakes Victoria, Tanganyika, and Nyasa.  \nNational parks are areas created and protected by law for the purpose of conservation of wildlife and its associated habitat. Examples of National Parks in Tanzania include Serengeti, Mikumi, Lake Manyara, Ruaha, Gombe, Mahale, Katavi, Kitulo, Saadani, Kilimanjaro, Mkomazi, Saanane Island, Rubondo, Nyerere National Park at Selous (the upper part of Selous), Udzungwa, and Tarangire. Game reserves include the lower part of Selous (which is the largest protected area in Tanzania), Rukwa, Ugalla, and Maswa. Ngorongoro conservation area is the only protected area in Tanzania where humans, livestock, and wildlife live together in the same environment.  \nTourism industry creates employment and stimulates the growth of service sectors such as transport, hospitality, insurance, communications, and tour guiding.

It aims to produce enough food for the wellbeing of families. In some instances, when the production is high, the surplus is sold. Individuals engaging in small-scale crop cultivation are known as peasants. They are also called subsistence farmers as they grow food crops to feed themselves and their families with little or no surplus for sale.  \nAs noted earlier, the agricultural system at subsistence level falls under this category. A farmer owns a small piece of land for food crops cultivation. The produce is enough only for the family. It is hand to mouth existence which may lead to famine if the harvest is bad. In years with good harvest the farmer may have surplus to sell to the local markets. The farms are small, about one to five hectares owned by the family. Application of machines is difficult as farms are small.  \nSmall-scale crop cultivation is done by using different methods such as shifting cultivation, crop rotation, and bush fallowing.",

        "page_content": "#### Shifting cultivation:  \nThis is a traditional system of cultivation used in tropical rainforest and miombo wooded savanna. It operates where the population is sparse. People farm and move to another fresh area when the yields are low. The cultivator or farmer burns the forest and sows seeds in the intermixed ash and soil. Little attention is given to the crops until they ripen. If the harvest declines, the land is abandoned, and a fresh area is cleared. The yields decline after three to five years. The cultivator may return to the original land after some years. The constant moves ensure fresh land with high yields, as the land is fertile. There is no serious soil erosion since only a small area is exposed which supports many crops and therefore little bare earth is seen. Any soil washed is trapped by dense plant roots and at the forest edge. The system is less risky of diseases. The methods used in shifting cultivation differ with people\u2019s culture and the varieties of crops they grow. Some use fire to clear the land. Such a system results in wastage of valuable timber, which took over a hundred years to grow but destroyed in a few days. Green manure is ruined and soil profile is altered by the destruction of bacteria and humus. Areas practising this system include Malawi, Zambia, Liberia, and Uganda. In Zambia this system is called 'slash and burn' agriculture or the 'Chitemene.' Shifting cultivation in Tanzania is commonly known in Kiswahili language as 'kiliminocha kuhamahama' (shifting agriculture), but also unofficially known as 'mahame' (shifted land) or 'malale' (fallow land). Regions practising shifting cultivation include Morogoro, Lindi, Rukwa, Mbeya, Iringa, Tabora, Dodoma and Tanga. In Tabora, for example, tobacco farming relies heavily on shifting cultivation.",

They clear the bush, burn the vegetation, and sow seeds. Yield declines after three to five years. The farm is left to regain its fertility for nearly ten years. Another bush is cleared and cultivated. No movement is involved in bush fallowing. This is possible in areas with dense population. Small-scale crop cultivation is advantageous to farmers. It allows them to grow varieties of food crops. Different crops grown in small farms make it easy to control pests and diseases. Elementary tools such as pangas, hand hoes and axes lead to low cost of running the farms, hence low capital involved.

Yet, subsistence farmers are not likely to raise their output to feed the growing numbers because of lack of capital. Subsequently, land becomes overpopulated and resources overused.

It depends much on the available resources in a given area. When an area has more people than it can support to give them a reasonable standard of living, the area will suffer from overpopulation or population pressure. If the area has inhabitants who are too few to develop the resources available to improve living conditions, then the area suffers from under-population.  \nPopulation pressure is caused by rapid increase of population. In Third World countries, population is growing rapidly and food demand is high whereas food production is low. As the population increases, shortage of land in the productive areas becomes a source of serious concern. In some parts of regions such as Kilimanjaro, Mara, Kigoma, Shinyanga, Mbeya, Manyara and Morogoro, where a high population increase has occurred, land shortage has become a serious problem. In fact, the land available has been over cultivated and exhausted, hence paving way to soil erosion. Over the years, many people have been migrating from their homelands to other regions in search of fertile land for cultivation.  \nThe resulting population growth affects land use patterns. This may cause shortage of food and poor living standards. The solution to this problem is to improve small-scale crop cultivation. The government and other organisations should help farmers by providing them with education and capital to make subsistence agriculture more intensive and more productive. Moreover, the government, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and co-operative societies should help the farmers to select better seeds, use proper insecticides, pesticides, and apply fertilisers properly. In addition, they should help in providing transport to make sure the products reach proper storage places and markets. Furthermore, the government should emphasise and support the opening of joint agriculture ventures, finding of markets for surplus products and establishing good storage facilities. Additionally, deliberate efforts should be made to provide education on good farming practises, for example, the use of simple but improved farming technology.",

After independence of individual countries, the plantations were owned by government and others were allocated to individuals as small holders and peasant farmers. These plantations also known as estates are large and found in sparsely populated areas.  \nCrops from the plantations for example sisal and tobacco are processed before leaving the plantation and further processed right after harvesting to raise the value of the product per unit weight, and reduce its weight for long distance transferring.

Also, it is often based on a single crop, a practise known as monoculture. Chemical fertilisers are highly used to maximise yields.

It requires heat, humidity, and abundant rainfall. The plant grows in warm to hot temperature ranging between 16\u00b0-21\u00b0C. Coffee needs abundant rainfall ranging from 1100 mm to 1780 mm annually and a relatively dry season for picking. Growth is most rapid during the hot rainy season, and during the cool dry season berries ripen and are ready for picking. Growth is most rapid during the hot rainy season, and during the cool dry season berries ripen and are ready for picking. Bright sunshine and warm weather are necessary for the harvesting. Hill slopes, which receive orographic rainfall, are thus best for coffee cultivation.  \n##### Shade  \nDirect sunlight is harmful for coffee plants; therefore, these are planted under shade of taller trees such as bananas. An ideal shade tree should belong to the leguminous type, because these not only provide shade but also enrich soil with nitrogen. Traditionally, most of the varieties of coffee plants were shade grown, as they were naturally intolerant of direct sunlight, hence they preferred a canopy of sun-filtering shade trees. The trees in coffee plantations play several roles including the following:  \nFigure 2.2 Coffee-producing regions in Tanzania  \nSource: Coffeeboard.or.tz/news_Publications2009  \ni. Protecting coffee from direct sunlight. Trees reduce the amount of heat reaching the coffee plant during the daytime.  \nii. Acting as physical barrier by protecting coffee plants from destruction by winds.  \niii. Mulching the soil with their fallen leaves which helps to protect the soil from excessive temperature and retain soil moisture thereof reducing evaporation.  \niv. Minimizing the erosive power of rainfall by acting as a physical barrier in reducing the amount of the rain reaching the ground.  \nv. Maintaining the organic matter content in the soil which creates a conducive environment for many beneficial microorganisms like nitrogen fixers; hence trees contribute to soil fertility.  \nvi. Providing a lively habitat, which is able to harbor different bird species. The birds help to facilitate pollination and serve as a biological insect control. Due to increasing demand of coffee, a scientific way of productivity which involve growing coffee plants in the open sun, was developed for coffee farming. This approach is accompanied with the continued application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides which, among other things, make up for the loss of nutrients.  \n##### Topography  \nGenerally, coffee is grown on slopes having a height between 600 to 1,800 meters. Water stagnation is very harmful for coffee plants; therefore, hill slopes are best suitable for growing coffee.  \n##### Soils  \nSoil is the guiding factor in coffee plantation. Coffee plantation requires deep well drained soils which are rich in humus, minerals nutrients and of good texture to allow free air circulation.",

        "page_content": "#### Maize  \nMaize is a cereal crop whose origin is South America. It is one of the most widely cultivated cereals grown in both tropical and warm temperate latitudes. In Tanzania, maize is widely grown as a staple food. Major maize producing regions are Rukwa, Katavi, Mbeya, Songwe, Njombe, Morogoro, Iringa, and Ruvuma. Countries that are major maize growers in the world are United States of America, China, Brazil, South Africa, Russia, Yugoslavia, and Romania.  \n##### Conditions for growing maize:  \nMaize grows well in areas that experience summer temperatures of between 18\u00b0C and 27\u00b0C. It also needs a period of 140 frost-free days and annual precipitation ranging from 635 mm \u2013 1,145 mm. Maize grows in a wide range of soil types. However, it grows better in deep rich soils of the sub-tropics with abundant nitrogen. In the tropics, maize can grow at altitudes ranging from sea level to 2,900 m above sea level. A dry sunny season is important for maize to grow, to enable cobs to ripen and the seeds to dry.  \n##### Farm preparation, planting and caring of maize:  \nMaize requires deep tillage which is done by a hand-hoe and ox-drawn plough in small-scale or subsistence farming, and by using tractors in large-scale or commercial agriculture. Planting is done by burying seeds directly in the soil in a depth of at least 10 cm with spacing of 75 cm between the rows and 30 cm between the plants. Germination usually takes place under warm, moist conditions. Seedlings emerge after about 6 - 10 days. However, under cool or dry conditions this may take two weeks or more. The optimum temperature range for germination is between 20\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C.  \nMaize needs good care which includes weeding, thinning and pest and disease management.  \nWeeds compete with maize plants for water, nutrients, space, and light which reduce plant yield. The early stage of a maize plant (first three weeks) is very sensitive to weed competition. Weeding in a maize farm can be done using the hand-hoe, machine, or through chemical weed control (herbicides).  \n##### Harvesting, processing and transportation of maize:  \nMaize can be harvested after 3 - 6 months depending on variations in temperature and seed types. Harvesting methods include manual hand cut and machines (combine harvesters). The mechanised system removes not only the ear or husk from the plant but also the grain from the cob whereas hand harvesting requires initial removal of the ear or husk, which is shelled at a later stage. The grain is winnowed to remove unwanted materials and low-quality grains. Then the product is stored in bags ready for transportation to homesteads, and some to silos and to the market.  \n##### Uses of maize:  \nMaize is a staple food in Africa and Asia. It is also used to feed domestic animals such as cattle, pigs, and chicken. Maize is also used to make industrial products such as vegetable oil, starch, and alcohol. Domestically, maize stocks and cobs are burned to produce heat energy for cooking mainly in rural areas. Maize stalks are also used to make manure.",

        "page_content": "#### Wheat:  \nWheat is one of cereal crops which grows well in temperate regions. Wheat in Tanzania is grown almost exclusively as a commercial crop on a large-scale basis in the northern highlands (Manyara) and by small and medium scale farmers in the southern highlands (Njombe). It is also grown in Angola, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It is also grown in Greenland and distributed from Scandinavia to South America and across Asia.  \n##### Conditions for growing wheat:  \nWheat grows well in warm temperatures ranging from 21\u00b0C to 24\u00b0C. Wheat also needs a lot of sunshine, especially when the grains are filling. Areas with low humidity are better since many wheat diseases thrive in damp weather. The amount of rainfall required for wheat cultivation varies between 300 mm and 1,000 mm. The major wheat lands of the temperate regions have an annual rainfall of 380 mm - 800 mm.  \n##### Farm preparation, planting and caring of wheat:  \nIf the field has been previously used for farming purposes, it is recommended to smoothen the soil with a rake. A shovel is attached to a tractor to plough the field and dig long narrow furrows. Moderate quantities of natural manure are used to fertilise the soil and ensure proper growth of the wheat stalks. Wheat seeds are spread in the furrows using a semicircular movement of the wrist or a grain drill attached to a tractor. Immediately after planting the wheat seeds, watering is important. This is also done once each month during the growing season. If an area gets a lot of rain, it might not need to be watered at all. Fertiliser is used twice during the growing season. Although it may look primitive, several plastic flags or streamers are placed throughout the wheat patch. The noise made by the plastic blowing in the breeze deters birds from landing and scares off any birds that are already in the field. This prevents birds from eating the wheat seeds before they can sprout.  \n##### Harvesting, processing, and transportation of wheat:  \nIn the process of harvesting, there is a need to test the crop. In this regard, fingers are used to rub the wheat head and pieces of grain are chewed. If the grains crack in the mouth and become soft as they are chewed, then they are ready for harvesting. Clean places are prepared for keeping the harvested wheat. When using a sickle for harvesting, it should be checked to make sure it is sharp enough for making clean cuts. In commercial farming, Rice the combine harvester is adjusted to harvest the wheat. Harvesting is done when the crop reaches maturity (at least 100 days). The part that is harvested is called kernels. Freshly harvested wheat is taken to a local grain elevator as soon as possible after harvest.  \nAs wheat arrives in the mill, it passes through a cleaning process to remove coarse impurities, and to separate the grain by size, shape and weight. The finished product, that is, the whole pure wheat then goes through conditioning bins before milling to produce a uniform moisture content to prevent break-up of the bran (hard outer layer) during milling. After conditioning, different batches of wheat are blended together to make a mix capable of producing the required quality. Wheat is sold raw to manufacturers. From here it is milled into finished consumable products. On large farms, harvesting is done by combine harvesters whereas on small farms, it is done by hand using sickles. It is normally transported by road in lorries from the farm to the market and silos.  \n##### Uses of wheat:  \nWheat serves as food for human beings and animals. Human beings use wheat to make bread, cakes and, sometimes, stiff porridge. The remains of wheat are used to feed animals. Wheat starch is used in the manufacturing of paper. For example, in the United States wheat is used to strengthen paper.",

        "page_content": "#### Rice  \nRice is an edible seed from one of the grass species. As a cereal crop, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world\u2019s human population, especially in Asia. It is an agricultural commodity with the third- highest worldwide production. Rice is grown in most regions of Tanzania including Coast, Morogoro, Tabora, Mbeya, Mwanza, Shinyanga, Simiyu, and Geita. Globally, it is grown in China, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Thailand, Japan and Kenya.  \n##### Conditions for growing rice:  \nRice is a tropical crop which grows well where the average temperature during the growing season is between 20\u00b0C and 27\u00b0C. Abundant sunshine is also essential during its four months of growth. The minimum temperature should not go below 15\u00b0C as germination cannot take place below that temperature. Rice requires more water than any other crop. As a result, paddy cultivation is done only in those areas where minimum rainfall is 1,150 mm. Paddy also needs flooded conditions with the depth of water varying over 25 mm at the time of transplanting to as much as 150 mm for 10 weeks of the growing period.  \n##### Farm preparation, planting and care of rice:  \nPlanting work begins with land preparation as well as the nursery bed for obtaining the seedlings. The seedlings should be planted as young as possible, usually at 20 days. Seeds are planted by removing them from the nursery to the paddy fields. Good rice planting should use the pull to the right and to the left with a distance of 20 cm x 20 cm. This is to enable maintenance, either weeding or fertilising in addition to allowing each plant to receive enough sunlight and nutrients evenly. Seedlings are planted with just one seed in one planting hole. Farmers are required to maintain water and water discharge on paddy fields and weeding (weed control). Irrigating rice crops in rice fields should consider the depth of water in accordance with the age of the plant. Weeds are herbs that live with cultivated plants and are generally very harmful to rice crops. As such, weeding is very important. Fertilisation is done to add nutrients needed by plants in the soil. As the grain begins to mature, the farmers \u2018lock up\u2019 the water on the bays. This means no water leaves the paddock as it is fully utilised by the rice plant. The soil then dries out in time for harvest to begin.  \n##### Harvesting, processing and transportation of rice:  \nRice is processed in the following ways. Step one involves removal of the hard protective husk. The rice husk is the protective layer surrounding the grain. Once removed, the rice grain is packaged as brown rice. Brown rice is healthy because it still contains the rice germ and outer bran layers which is important for healthy body functions. Step two involves removal of the germ and brown layers. Gentle milling removes the germ and bran layers from the grain to expose a white starch center. The polished white starch center is what we know as white rice. Large-scale farmers use large conventional grain harvesters whereas small-scale farmers use sharp sickles for harvesting. Farmers use tractors, power tillers and lorries to transport paddy from the farm to grain storage facilities at the farm or home or silos for large-scale grain storage. Rice in Tanzania and in most parts of the world is mostly sold to consumers as polished milled rice. From the farmers it is sold directly to the millers or middlemen.  \n##### Uses of rice:  \nRice is used in many ways for food and other purposes. The bran is used to make oil. Straws (grass) from the leaves and stems are used for weaving roof tops, baskets, hats, bedding and for feeding animals. Husks are used as a source of energy in bricks making.  \n##### Table 2.2 Some major cereal crops grown in Tanzania  \n| Crop  | Regions                                                                     |\n| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Maize | Rukwa, Katavi, Mbeya, Songwe, Njombe, Morogoro, Kigoma, Iringa and Ruvuma   |\n| Wheat | Manyara and Njombe                                                          |\n| Rice  | Coast, Morogoro, Mbeya, Mwanza, Shinyanga, Arusha, Kigoma, Simiyu and Geita |",

Large-scale farming requires a large capital investment to buy machinery and farm inputs, prepare land and pay farm labourers. It also relies on seasonal rainfall. Climatic changes have largely affected the amount of rainfall in many areas of Tanzania. Since the majority of large-scale farmers in Tanzania rely on rain-fed agriculture, whenever there is a shortage of rainfall, agricultural production falls. Agricultural products from large-scale crop cultivation in Tanzania such as tea, sisal and coffee face stiff competition from other countries that produce the same crops. As a result, prices of such products tend to be low. In addition, large-scale crop cultivation in Tanzania has to contend with pests and diseases. Pests such as army worms and quelea quelea tend to destroy crops faster than measures aimed to control them can cope. Inadequate management of pest invasion leads to heavy loss of crop production. Similarly, the outbreak of diseases such as Coffee Berry Diseases (CBD) and army worms affect crops before they are ready for harvesting, which leads to low production.",

Moreover, there is also a need to establish and expand irrigation schemes through public and private partnerships. Furthermore, farmers should be empowered through the establishment of co-operative banks for loan provision and sustainable markets. There is also a need to enforce a mechanism aimed to ensure extension officers work in the field with farmers where they can provide technical assistance on the selection of seeds, use of fertilisers and pesticides, and processing and packaging of crops. Also provision of real-time weather related information to farmers is necessary.",

Agriculture is a major industry in the USA, which is a net exporter of food. Although agricultural activity occurs in every state, it is particularly concentrated in the Great Plains, a vast expanse of flat, arable land at the center of the nation in the region around the Great Lakes known as the Corn Belt. Corn is another name for maize which is a chief cereal crop. The economy of the USA heavily depends on manufacturing industries. However, it is so diversified and characterized with a variety of sectors including services, entertainment, telecommunications and agriculture.  \nAgriculture, which is highly mechanised, operates on a large-scale and makes a significant contribution to the USA economy through provision of employment opportunities to about 11% of the Americans. Through agriculture the country also earns foreign currency, which helps to increase the National Domestic Product (NDP) through the export of beverages and other processed foods. Improvement of standards of living of the people who live near plantations such as the Cotton and Corn belts is another contribution of large-scale agriculture in the USA. Furthermore, the country has benefited significantly from development and growth of beef and dairy farming industries, which employ the largest percentage, followed by bakery, fruit and vegetable plants.

Some of them are high cost of production as agriculture in the USA is highly mechanised. Automatic irrigation and agricultural machinery require fossil fuels and other sources of energy to run them. The increase in the price of fossil fuel, therefore, increases the cost of production. At times, there is a shortage of water as irrigation requires a lot of water. The amount of underground water drawn for irrigation is increasing whereas the amount of water to refill is decreasing; which results in shortage of water for agricultural use. Another problem has to do with loss of soil fertility as the soil is eroded faster than it can be replenished due to over- cultivation. Also, over-irrigation causes leaching of soil nutrients.  \nOther challenges include the high cost of land management in large-scale agriculture where monoculture is a common practise. Monoculture exhausts nutrients from the soil that requires constant application of fertilisers. Natural disasters such as drought, hurricanes, floods and tornadoes also pose severe challenges to agricultural production. Crops are damaged by periodic drought, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes. This damage leads to low production which, ultimately, affects the economy. The natural disasters also affect transportation network which finally hinders the movement of agricultural products from the field to storage and market centers.",

People involved in this practice are called nomads or pastoralists. Tribes which practise nomadic pastoralism include the Maasai, Barbaig, Kwavi, and Karamajong. Nomadic pastoralism is mostly practised in sparsely populated areas where the natural vegetation is mainly grass and bushes and, sometimes, scattered trees. In these areas, rainfall is very low and unreliable. The pastoralists follow specific routes in their movements. Figure 2.10 shows a large herd of cattle. The animals kept by pastoralists are a source of food and income through the selling of animals and their products. Major products from animals are meat and milk. The pastoralists spend the money they earn to meet family needs such as buying cereals, paying school fees, and meeting health expenses. In addition, the cattle raised are used for paying bride price and giving gifts as well as slaughtering during cultural festivals. To the nomads, animals are a symbol of wealth and prestige.  \nFigure 2.10. A large herd of cattle.\nSource: http://learn.e-limu.org/topic/view/?c=48&t=276",

As a result, overgrazing causes soil erosion, land degradation, and loss of valuable species. Another feature of the nomadic pastoralists is the breeding process, which is uncontrolled. This situation may lead to the spread and outbreak of animal diseases, hence low animal quality and deaths.  \nIn addition, there is poor control of pests and other diseases, which result to poor quality of animal products. Furthermore, nomadic pastoralism takes place where the population is scarce as the animals are grazed in open range, which needs a lot of space.",

This season is associated with scarcity of grass and water. Also, the semi-nomads\u2019 movements contribute to the spread of diseases among their livestock. Semi-nomads usually cultivate crops during the rainy season to sustain their lives.",

        "page_content": "#### Transhumance:  \nTranshumance is a seasonal movement of livestock from one grazing ground to another, specifically to lowlands in winter and highlands in summer. It is a form of semi-nomadic pastoralism in which domestic animals play a predominant but not an exclusive role in shaping the economic and cultural life of the people who depend on them.  \nUnder transhumance, pastoralism is a predominant economic activity with varying emphasis on agriculture as a supplementary activity. Countries that practise transhumance include Switzerland, Morocco, Kosovo and the Sudan-Sahelian zone of Mali.  \n##### Advantages of transhumance:  \nTranshumance has several advantages including an attempt to maximise productivity by exploiting annual grazing imbalances. This ensures the availability of pasture to feed the animals throughout the year. It also enhances income earning from the sale of pastoral products. In addition, it stimulates considerable national, regional and international trade. Transhumance provides raw materials such as dairy and non-wood forest products for local industries. Moreover, it provides services to other sectors of the economy, thus serving as a complementary resource for the country\u2019s overall economy. It also offers many jobs for pastoral communities and a diversity of actors involved in the livestock marketing circuit and value chain for other products.  \n##### Disadvantages of transhumance:  \nTranshumance has disadvantages as it accelerates deforestation (as the case of southern regions of Mali), causes damage to crops, increases conflicts and contributes to natural resource degradation.  \n##### Sedentary livestock-keeping:  \nSedentary livestock-keeping involves keeping animals in a permanent place. In fact, this type of keeping animals is called sedentary when livestock are permanently held in an area. Sedentary livestock-keeping is also known as zero grazing. This type livestock-keeping is characterised by a small number of animals that are kept in sheds.  \n##### Advantages of sedentary livestock-keeping:  \nThe size of the livestock makes it easy to control diseases since livestock- keepers use modern methods of treatment. Sedentary livestock-keeping also takes place in places where the population prevents the movement of animals from one place to another in search of food and water. Keeping animals in barns also enables the keepers to engage in other economic activities such as trade. Sedentary livestock-keeping can either be for food or commercial purposes.  \n##### Disadvantages of sedentary livestock-keeping:  \nDespite the advantages sedentary livestock-keeping presents, it is labour-intensive and can be time- consuming. It is also expensive in terms of building barns, feeding and taking care of the animals. In fact, livestock- keepers under the sedentary system sometimes have to deal with scarcity of animal feeds. This shortage may lower productivity particularly due to change of weather conditions such as prolonged drought.  \nIn Tanzania, sedentary livestock- keeping is commonly practised among the Chagga of Kilimanjaro, Meru of Arusha and the Bena of Njombe. In Kenya, sedentary livestock keeping is commonly practised by the Kikuyu and to some extent the Kamba. Figure 2.11 exemplifies sedentary livestock-keeping.  \n| Figure 2.11                               | Sedentary livestock-keeping |\n| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |\n| Source:flickr.com/photos/ilri/16563813546 |                             |",

Ranching, as part of commercial livestock-keeping, is mostly practised in more remote areas where land is extensive and population density is low. Extensive land provides sufficient grass to support a large number of animals. Commercial livestock-keeping is determined by factors such as capital, level of technology, market, availability of pasture and climatic conditions. In temperate regions, supplementary food such as hay and root crops are used to feed them during winter. Animals are kept for meat (beef cattle), for milk (dairy cattle and camel) and for wool (sheep).  \nFor such commercial livestock-keeping, land is managed to control soil erosion. Pasture for grazing and supplementary food also exist. In the meantime, water holes are created to ensure the availability of water for livestock and dips for pest control. Grazing is controlled by dividing the ranch into fenced-off sections known as paddocks.\nUnder this system, cattle move from one paddock to another to ensure that once a paddock has been grazed it has time to recover fully before being used again. Examples of ranches in Tanzania include Ruvu and Kongwa. There are many countries in the world with ranching systems. These countries include Argentina, USA, Northern Australia, Iran, India, China and New Zealand.  \nDairy cattle keeping is common in areas where pasture is rich and where animals are fed with high quality fodder during winter. Moist and mild climates favour the growth of good pasture. Dairy farming deals with milk production for sale either in liquid form or as butter and cheese. Moreover, milk is condensed into powder especially in areas which are far from dairy farms. Dairy farming is a common practise in countries such as the USA, Germany, China, Netherlands, Brazil, India, Britain, Argentina and Australia. In Africa, dairy cattle-keeping countries include Tanzania and Namibia.",

Inadequate financial capital government for investing in commercial livestock farming is another challenge.  \nLivestock-keeping is affected by poor transportation for animal products from farms to markets because some areas are inaccessible. In some cases, pastoralists suffer because of unreliable markets and poor storage facilities. As a result of poor transportation networking, especially due to poor and inaccessible roads, their animal-based products get spoiled before reaching the market. However, the market is very limited because of the low purchasing power of the people in some areas. Thislowpurchasingpoweraffectsthe income of livestock-keepers and, as a result, they fail to purchase vaccines for the growth and health of animals. Moreover, insufficient availability of seminars and training on modern livestock-keeping methods lead to low production. In some areas, animals are kept traditionally due to low-level of technology. The changing climate further compromises the availability of water and pasture for the animals.",

Also, over-grazing causes shortage of water, pasture and soil erosion. There is also a problem of poor transportation of livestock and livestock products from one place to another. In addition, low level of technology to improve the animal breeds as well as preserve animal products has been another limitation in the development of livestock-keeping in the country. These challenges lead to low quality and productivity. The low livestock production in turn, lowers the quality of life of livestock-keepers and affects development generally. Lack of reliable markets is a serious threat to the sustainability of the livestock-keeping sector.  \nIn addition, low capital investment limits the development of the livestock- keeping sector in the country. Also, inadequate land for grazing leads to conflicts between farmers and pastoralists. Nomadic pastoralists, for example, always move from one place to another in search of pasture and water. As a result, they sometimes graze on the farms, hence conflicts arise between them and farmers. With nomadic pastoralism, the animals get tired due to long distances over which they move. Sometimes, the animals get sick and die, thus leading to low production in terms of quality and quantity.  \n##### Ways of solving challenges facing livestock-keeping in Tanzania:  \nChallenges to livestock-keeping canbereducedthroughencouraging and supporting individual livestock keepers and their groups to buy modern accessories such as modern cattle sheds, cattle mats and cool roofs that would improve their livestock-keeping. In this regard, they would need support with training in modern livestock-keeping coupled with easily accessible extension services.

The livestock export industry supports the livelihood of many people in both rural and urban areas. The sector contributes to about 45% of the gross value of annual production of Australia\u2019s agricultural sector.  \nThe Australian government has responsibility in the export of livestock. Its Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, for example, regulates exports in the country\u2019s livestock industry. Livestock exporters must meet high animal welfare standards in the areas of production and transportation. The Merino is one of the most prevalent and economically influential breeds of sheep.  \nThe Merino sheep breed produces high quality wool products not only in Australia but also in other parts of the world. The Australian Merino is not a single homogenous breed but a number of \u2018strains\u2019 of sheep of which, regardless of their origins, are uniquely Australian. The Merino originally came from Spain. Australian livestock industries are spread geographically throughout the entire continent. Sheep production is largely located in the southern states whereas beef production is found in every state and territory. Furthermore, pork, dairy and poultry tend to concentrate in regions that are reasonably near the major metropolitan areas or along the coast.  \n##### Challenges facing livestock keeping in Australia  \nLivestock farming is affected by climate change and weather, particularly changes in temperature and water. The increase in temperature affects the quality and quantity of pasture and forage crops.  \nDiseases may also increase due to changes in weather and climatic conditions. In addition, the establishment of cattle and sheep keeping in most cases have resulted in negative environmental impacts. The livestock industry is also a major source of land degradation, water pollution, in addition to being a driver of deforestation. It also faces a shortage of skilled labour. This type of labour is characterised by higher education and expertise levels obtained through training and experience. Such expertise also demands higher salaries. The shortage of such highly skilled labour force can hinder operations in the livestock industries, hence reduce productivity and lower the national income.

Water can exist in liquid, solid, or gas state. Although water is a familiar substance, it is also a unique material of the earth. For a long time, water has been considered to be an abundant resource which is found freely to all people. Today, most countries are facing increasing pressure on water resources and growing competition between differing interests. Chronic water scarcity is perceived to be one of the threats to global prosperity and stability. Other threats include hydrological uncertainty and extreme weather disasters such as floods and droughts.  \nAccess to water is fundamental to economic and social development. However, population growth, rapid urbanisation and industrialisation, the expansion of agriculture and tourism, and climate change all put water under increasing stress. This situation has impacted negatively the socio-economic development of most developing countries. As a result, at the global level, there is a major concern regarding the management of water resources. Water resources management emerged as a response to real and foreseen water crises and increasingly unsustainable pressure on the freshwater resources, which emanate from rising populations, growing demands for water due to competing water uses, and increasing pollution.  \nWater resource management refers to the process of planning, developing, distributing and managing the effective use of water resources. In today\u2019s interconnected world, there is no doubt about the value of integrated planning for sustainable development. There is a need to have an integrated water resources management that supports the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. Integrated Water Resources Management is one of the initiatives for sustainable use of water resources, and it refers to a process of promoting the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources, in order to maximise the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems. The management helps to protect the environment, foster economic growth and sustainable agricultural development, promote democratic participation in governance, and improve human health.",

Clouds are masses of water droplets which continue to accumulate and when they are saturated, they become dense and fall as rain. Condensation is a very essential process in the hydrological cycle because it leads to the formation of clouds which produce rainfall (Figure 3.4).

Numerous economic activities are conducted in water while others use water as part of raw material.  \nHuman beings are primary users of water and integrate it in their economic activities in various ways. Their ability to plan and conduct economic activities is basically supported by water. Water is used as an important ingredient in sustaining life, especially for cooking, drinking and maintaining cleanliness. Generally, water is essential for economic development. It is used in the manufacturing industry, hydro-electric power generation, and navigation as well as domestic activities and trade.  \nMoreover, water is used in various processing and manufacturing industries for the production of food and beverages. It is important in mixing ingredients that are added to raw materials during food and beverage processing and production. For example, water is a component of most beverages such as soft drinks, milk, coffee and tea. These beverages contribute to the economy of many countries as a source of income generation. They are sold locally and exported to earn foreign income. Other industrial uses of water include cooling and washing.  \nAlso, water is important for irrigation purposes. Many countries around the world do not depend completely on rainfall for agriculture due to its uneven distribution. To ensure that agricultural activities are carried out largely for commercial purposes, irrigation has proven to be the best option. For example, in Tanzania, there are irrigation schemes in rice paddy plantations; these are Mbarali rice farm, Kapunga rice farm in Mbeya Region and sugar-cane plantations in Kilombero and Mtibwa in Morogoro Region; and Kagera sugar plantation in Kagera Region. Other countries which use water for irrigation on a large-scale in Africa include Sudan and Egypt. The irrigated plantations produce high output which contributes to economic development through sale in local markets and for exportation.  \nWater is also a source of electrical power. Modern economies depend much on the supply of electricity. One of the sources of electric power is water to produce what is commonly known as hydroelectric power (HEP). HEP is one of the cheapest and environmentally friendly sources of power. This power is used in industries to run machines, transport goods and provide services as well as in communication systems. Moreover, power contributes to the establishment of small and large-scale economic activities which eventually contribute to the economic growth of a given country. Furthermore, water is useful in the navigation sector in various ways. Human beings navigate different vessels such as canoes, boats, ferries and ships to move people and goods. Transportation of heavy machines for factories and industries, vehicles, timber and logs is made possible on water. In Tanzania, water transport on lakes and oceans facilitates the importation and exportation of various goods such as machines and vehicles. In fact, water as a means of transport is likely to reduce the transport cost compared to other means of transport and, hence, contribute meaningfully to economic growth. Water is the habitat for aquatic organisms such as fish which are useful to human beings. Usually, water bodies such as oceans, sea, lakes, rivers, dams and ponds attract fishing and, hence, fishing related activities. Fishing provides human beings with food and income through local selling and exportation of fishing products. In addition, water is used for trading which supports local communities to earn income and the government to get the much-needed revenue.  \nOther uses of water which contribute to economic growth and prosperity are tourism and sports. Some water sceneries attract local and foreign tourists which helps to earn income for the host countries. Water-based sports such as skiing, surfing, canoeing and diving are also sources of income.",

The size of the family influences the household water demand and use, hence making it central to any measurement of socio-economic status. Indeed, the larger the family, the higher the water demand for domestic use. With adequate and reliable supply of water, the quality of life is improved as families will not need to spend most of their time searching for water.  \nInternational Treaties and Declarations of the United Nations recognise the right to water as essential for securing an adequate standard of living. The reason is that water is one of the most fundamental conditions for survival. The right to water emphasises that everyone should have access to sufficient, safe and affordable water for personal and domestic uses. Article 11 of Human Rights of the United Nations recognises the right of everyone to adequate standard of living, including adequate health, sufficient food and shelter, all of which require access to clean water.  \nMany people in the world and particularly in the developing countries have inadequate water supply to meet their daily needs. Indeed, shortage of water has a serious health implication as it can lead to illness and even death among the poor in many developing countries. Water-borne diseases such as cholera, bilharzia, typhoid and diarrhoea are common in areas with scarcity of water supply.

        "page_content": "### Effects of distance to water sources on the girl-child in Tanzania  \nWater fetching in most Tanzanian societies is a cultural and gender-related activity in terms of who is responsible for carrying it from the sources. The responsibility of fetching water and the overall water management in households is influenced by gender and cultural norms. The burden of fetching water is borne by both women and children, particularly girls. They travel over long distances to fetch water for domestic purposes.  \nThese distances coupled with other factors such as difficult terrain, poor water flow, and queues at the water sources take a lot of time from girls. Fetching water appears to have a direct effect on the physical health of the girls and their ability to participate in domestic responsibilities.  \nChildren, particularly girls, experience pains or movement problems associated with walking long distances in search of water. This, in turn, is associated with disability linked to spinal disorders and cervical compression syndromes. In addition, walking over long distances while carrying water contributes to psycho-social and emotional suffering. The suffering can have general health implications that may lead to disability and affect work performance. Moreover, incidents and fear of physical and sexual violence are widely reported by women and children in relation to water-fetching activities.  \nThe extent of the problem of walking over long distances to water sources is more pronounced in low and middle income societies than in high income ones. Since economic, political and socialinequalitiesarereflectedinaccess to drinking water, the marginalised groups may suffer differently from the negative economic and health effects of carrying water over long distances. Furthermore, this situation leads to material deprivation for women, lack of voice and capacity to cope with any form of crisis. This, in turn, widens the poverty gap and gender inequalities in Tanzania.  \nIn addition, carrying water over long distances limits women\u2019s participation in productive economic activities, hence low school enrolment for girls. Access to water and sanitation is, therefore, related to the time that girls need to attend school, and can be among the reasons that keep them out of school. Therefore, access to fresh water and sanitation does not only improve the health of a family, but also provides an opportunity for girls to attend school and spend their time more productively on academics than on fetching water.",

        "page_content": "### Relationship between vegetation and water supply  \nVegetation refers to the collection of plants growing in a particular area under certain climatic conditions. Vegetation growth depends on various factors such as rainfall, temperature, soil, and relief. In particular, rainfall provides water which is required for the growth of plants. Areas with dense vegetation cover tend to experience high rates of evapotranspiration which is necessary for rain formation.  \nThe amount of water supply in a particular area also determines the type of vegetation growth. For example, due to their semi-arid climatic conditions, central parts of Tanzania such as Dodoma and Singida experience little rainfall in a year. The vegetation cover is mainly shrubs with little influence on the formation of rainfall. On the other hand, areas with equatorial climate are covered with thick vegetation (equatorial rainforests). This type of vegetation has a significant influence on rain formation due to high rates of evapotranspiration determined by high temperatures in these regions. High rainfall results in adequate water supply.  \nVegetation cover plays an important role in protecting catchment areas. In other words, vegetation reduces the amount of water loss in those areas. As a result, enough water supply to those areas is maintained. In Tanzania, the areas around the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro experience constant flow of water throughout the year because of the presence of thick vegetation cover.  \nIt should be noted that plants require different amounts of water for their growth. However, water is not evenly supplied. As such, plants adapt differently to their physical environment. This is one of the reasons for the different sizes and appearance of the plants in different geographical areas. For example, in dry areas, plants develop adaptation mechanisms.  \nThe leaves develop thorny leaves or a waxy surface to reduce loss of water through transpiration. Plants develop deep roots in the ground to reach water. Other plants develop storage organs. For example, a baobab tree stores water in its trunk. Some plants shed their leaves during periods of water scarcity. The relationship between vegetation and water supply may be influenced by human activities such as water drilling and deforestation. Water drilling may increase water supply in areas with water scarcity and, thus, influence the growth of the planted vegetation. On the other hand, deforestation exposes the area previously covered by the forest to evaporation and thus destroys the catchment areas. As a matter of fact, deforestation may turn an area into arid or semi-arid land.",

This increases the possibility of carrying out various development projects. Projects which take place in river basins should not have negative impacts on the people or the environment. The impacts may include disturbing the habitat of various species such as fish. Other impacts are water pollution, disease outbreak, and resettlement of villages.  \nIn Tanzania, environmental impacts are controlled by carrying out Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).

        "page_content": "#### Benefits of river basin development projects  \nThe benefits of a river basin project vary depending on the nature and scale of the project, location, and administrative structure. The lower section of rivers is usually exposed to excessive rainwater, causing floods. To prevent floods, basin management establishes dams which serve as collection areas of excessive water. River basins in their natural state may hardly be safe for human settlement. In fact, the establishment of basin development projects increases the value of the basins and makes them more conducive for human settlement. This compels governments to extend social services such as infrastructure, health, and education.  \nRiver basin development also attracts irrigation. Due to the availability of water in a basin, commercial agriculture is established through irrigation schemes. Sometimes, individual peasants use a well-managed river basin for watering their small farms using traditional mechanisms such as buckets. In addition, river basin development projects involve planting of trees and construction of dams. They also involve strict measures for prohibiting deforestation and poor cultivation practises. All these measures aim to foster appropriate use of the land to keep it productive. These measures also enable the preservation of the ecosystem. By doing so, these projects contribute to preventing the land from being eroded by environmental problems such as soil erosion, floods and loss of soil fertility.  \nBasin development projects involve the establishment of hydroelectric power plants following the construction of dams. The water from the dams is used to generate electricity for domestic and industrial purposes. In Tanzania, Mtera, Kidatu and Kihansi dams in Rufiji Basin are hydroelectric power stations. In addition to hydroelectric power, the constructed dams create opportunities for fishing; for example, Mtera Dam is oneofthedamswherefishingactivities take place. Moreover, well-managed basins which have gorges, waterfalls, man made reservoirs and land scenery attract tourism. Tourism is one of the potential sources of income and contributes significantly to the national economy.  \nBasin development projects also generate employment opportunities in agriculture, forestry, tourism, transport andfishing.Suchdevelopmentprojects contributetoincome generation for the country and, consequently, to the growth of its economy. Nevertheless, there are challenges resulting from the establishment and running of these projects.",

Many of these challenges are caused by natural events and human activitiesthattakeplaceinthebasins. These are described below.  \n##### Siltation  \nSiltation is one of the challenges facing river basin projects. The water in dams depends on the supply of water from highland areas through streams and rivers. Usually streams flowing into dams carry some sediments which ultimately accumulate in the dams. This accumulation of sediments leads to a decrease in the volume of water which may have numerous impacts. These impacts may include lowering the ability of dams to produce enough water necessary for electricity generation, in addition to affecting transport and destroying marine organisms.  \n##### Water pollution  \nWater pollution is another challenge related to the dam projects. In many cases, modern agriculture involves the use of agro-chemicals. These agro- chemicals dissolve in water and get transported to the dams through water streams which may affect marine organisms, including fish.  \n##### Costs  \nGenerally, the establishment and maintenance of river basin projects is costly. The cost may be higher particularly when the basins encounter unexpected natural events such as droughts or excessive rainfall. Whereas droughts reduce the volume of water in dams, excessive rainfall may lead to overflow and too much siltation in the dams. The overflow damages property and farms in outlining areas.  \n##### Trans-boundary conflicts  \nSome basin projects face management challenges as they extend to different countries. As a result, establishing any project in one of the partner countries of the basin may require a consensus from other countries which is not always guaranteed. For example, the Nile Basin is shared by Tanzania, Uganda, Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi and Eritrea. For decades, there has been complaints from upstream countries (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia and Sudan) about the dominant use of the Nile waters by Egypt. The Nile Valley Initiative is a project that aims to solve these disputes peacefully.",

It is one of the largest river basins in Africa, and covers an area of about 177,420 km2. This basin occupies 20 percent of the country. It occupies parts of Iringa, Njombe, Mbeya, Ruvuma, Morogoro, Dodoma and Pwani Regions (Figure 3.8).The basin contains the Rufiji River which is the largest river in Tanzania. It originates from the south-western highlands. It has four main tributaries, namely, the Great Ruaha, Kilombero, Luwegu and the Rufiji lower section. These four tributaries join to form the Rufiji River.  \nThere are several socio-economic activities within the basin which benefit individuals and the nation. These include agriculture, tourism, hydropower generation,fisheries, mining and livestock keeping. Land in the Rufiji Basin is used mainly for agriculture, tourism, wildlife conservation, fisheries and mining. Agriculture is mainly practised in the Usangu Plain in Mbeya and Kilombero Basin in Morogoro.  \nApart from being rich in water resources and biodiversity, the basin is endowed with a good climate, fertile soil, minerals and human resources. It is known for its agricultural production and is often called the \u201cbread basket\u201d of Tanzania. Within the basin, there are important national parks (Kitulo, Ruaha, Mikumi, Udzungwa and Uluguru), large game reserves (the lower part of Selous, Rungwa, Usangu, Mpanga/ Kipengere, and Lunda), forest reserves, and pasture for livestock. Fishery is practised in the Kilombero, Great Ruaha and Rufiji rivers.  \nMining projects are developed in the Selous Basin at Namtumbo District where Uranium is developed and copper project in Iringa District at Nyang\u2019oro Hills. Because of its large agricultural, hydroelectric and other potentials, the basin is the focus of the Government of Tanzania, donor and private development plans. It has also attracted large numbers of people migrating to the area seeking land for cropping and raising livestock. According to the national census of 2012, the districts within the basin had 9,032,089 people compared to 3,055,051 in 2002. It also contains Kihansi spray toads, which are a unique species for tourist attraction. These frog species are not found anywhere else in the world.  \n##### Benefits of the Rufiji Basin Water Board  \n1. It has promoted the market of HEP from Kidatu power plant.\n2. There has been flood control.\n3. It has led to the creation of employment opportunities in the valley, thus promoted living standards of people.\n4. It has led to the development of villages and towns, for example new towns like Kidatu, Makambako and Mikumi.\n5. The board provides expert advice to the farmers on good farming practice and solutions to their farming problems.\n6. A number of large irrigation projects on sugar and rice are carried out in the Kilombero Valley and Usangu Plains respectively.\n7. There has been an increase in the planting of teak and rubber trees in some parts of the Rufiji Basin. These trees can potentially benefit the timber and rubber industries in the country. The irrigation projects also increase agricultural products for food and commercial purposes.  \n##### Challenges facing the Rufiji Basin Water Board  \nApart from having benefits, the RBWB is also facing some challenges including the following:  \n1. Poor labour supply due to out-migration to urban centers.\n2. Diseases like cholera and malaria affect the farmers such that they fail to contribute effectively in the development of the scheme.\n3. Climate related problems like drought have been affecting water availability; sometimes the volume of water in the river decreases. Climatic changes are experienced in most parts of Tanzania including Rufiji Basin, with prolonged drought and unreliable rainfall leading to insufficient water supply. This situation affects food production in the basin, sugar plantations, HEP and wildlife.\n4. Transport problems prevail, especially during rainy season during which the area is not always accessible.  \nFigure 3.8 The Rufiji River Basin in Tanzania",

The Tennessee River Basin lies in a seven-state area in the south-eastern part of United States. Its drainage area covers 40,900 square miles (105,930 square kilometers), mostly in the State of Tennessee, but with parts also in Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.  \nFigure 3.9 Tennessee Valley Authority\nSource: bkushistory.pbworks.com tva  \nThe TVA was established in 1933 by the US Government. The development of TVA was triggered by social and economic conditions in the Tennessee Valley in the 1930s. During those years the region was largely rural and undeveloped, poverty-stricken, and characterised by degraded environmental conditions due to poor farming methods. Similarly, there was severe erosion, extensive deforestation and deteriorating environment.  \nThe establishment of the TVA was meant to achieve four key functions, which are: (i) To improve navigability and provide for the flood control of the Tennessee River; (ii) To provide for reforestation and the proper use of marginal lands in the Tennessee Valley; (iii) To provide for agricultural and industrial development of the Tennessee Valley; and (iv) To provide for national defence by the creation of a corporation for the operation of government properties. Later, after its establishment, the functions of the TVA were expanded to include:\ni. Management of the Tennessee Valley River system for multiple purposes including navigation, flood control, power generation, ensuring water quality, public land conversation, recreation, and economic development\nii. Generation of electricity;\niii.Sale and transmission of electricity to wholesales and large industrial customers; and\niv. Transmission of economic development activities that generate a higher quality of life for citizens of the Tennessee Valley.  \n##### Benefits of the Tennessee Valley Authority  \nThe TVA has achieved many aims for its establishment. These are described in the following sections.  \n###### Power generation  \nTVA has the responsibility of providing reliable, affordable electric power that helps businesses and families prosper. In 1998 the main sources of power were hydro and thermal, which represent nearly 14 percent of TVA\u2019s total generating capacity. In 2008 the authority supplied power to 159 local power companies that served 8.7 million people, and 650,000 businesses and industries in the seven-state TVA area. In 2017, TVA\u2019s power portfolio contained 30 dams or hydroelectric facilities, eight coal plants, 16 natural gas plants, three nuclear plants, 14 solar energy sites, and one wind energy site. Currently, TVA supplies power from a diverse energy portfolio that includes nuclear, coal-fired, natural gas, hydroelectric, and renewable power. This is supplied to more than 10 million customers within the valley. Today, TVA is the largest public utility and one of the largest electricity providers in the United States. Likewise, the generation of power has stimulated different manufacturing and heavy industries in the valley.  \n###### Environmental stewardship  \nTVA was mandated with the responsibility of managing the natural resources in the Valley for the benefit of the region and the nation. For example, the TVA manages the Tennessee River system and neighbouring public lands so as to reduce flooding, maintain navigation channels, support power production and recreation, improve water quality and supply, and protect shoreline resources. Currently, the authority has a sophisticated system of dams to control flooding along the Tennessee River watershed. This provides an opportunity of controlling the floods by controlling about $ 260 million in flood damage annually. To date, the operation of this system has prevented over US$5.4 billion in flood losses across the Tennessee Valley, including about US$ 4.9 billion in damage averted at Chattanooga the Valley\u2019s most flood-prone city. The system has also prevented about US$ 470millioninfloodlossesinthelower Ohio and Mississippi River drainage basin.  \n###### Economic development  \nTVA builds businesses and community partnerships that bring jobs to the region and keep them there with a view to making the economy stronger. For example, the Tennessee River has always been a key to the economic development of the TVA through commercial ships which facilitate the movement of goods and machinery. Likewise, the authority managed to construct dams which increase the water supply for irrigation, domestic and industrial uses. Consequently, the dams have also led to the development of fishing industries for domestic and commercial purposes.  \nThe TVA has managed to increase the land for the cultivation of crops. The land, which was earlier affected by soil erosion, has now been controlled using various methods. Trees have been replanted and good cultivation practises, such as construction of terraces, have been applied on the valley slopes. All these measures have stabilised agricultural production, which is a good indicator of agriculture\u2019s contribution to the improvement of income of the people in the Tennessee Valley. The TVA was charged with the following short-term objectives: To control floods, improve navigation, develop HEP, improve the land along the river banks, conserve soils and carry out reforestation projects to check erosion in the region.  \nTVA was also involved in other activities such as industrial development, wildlife conservation, forest, road and rail development, malaria control, planning for towns and educating farmers in sound agriculture techniques. The long-term aim of TVA was to raise the standard of living of the people in the area. Moreover, the TVA has established more than 100 public parks and camping sites to attract tourists. Tourists visit the valley because of a number of attractive natural and man-made land sceneries. These developments in the basin have contributed to the establishment of a strong tourism industry in the valley.  \n###### Prospects of the Tennessee Valley Authority  \nThe Tennessee Valley Authority is one of the largest river basin development projects in the world. Despite the innumerable successes achieved so far, TVA still has more room to establish more development projects. The authority aims to exploit sustainably every potential opportunity undertaken in the valley. TVA intends to increase electricity production to meet the ever increasing demand for electricity in the valley. The authority has expressed a desire of achieving more success in its 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). This is a long-term plan that provides direction on how TVA can best meet the electricity demand in the next 20 years. TVA also intends to provide electricity to the people at a price affordable to everyone.  \nThrough this plan, TVA intends to provide regular updates to customers and stakeholders on every development and opportunity available.  \nIt has also plans to conduct periodical online seminars to the public. These seminars aim to inform the entire USA community on initiatives geared towards improving the Tennessee River Basin. The seminars also intend to collect views from the public on how to improve the valley in future. The main target of the projected improvement which is emphasised by TVA when seeking the views from the people include increasing tourist attraction centers, expanding employment opportunities, improving water quality and aquatic life. Generally, TVA plans to ensure that the Tennessee Valley becomes a habitable place with minimum challenges.",

In other words, land is changed from not being valuable to being valuable. It is turned into a state in which it can be used for growing crops, keeping animals, fostering settlement, and boosting industrial development.  \nWhen land is reclaimed, it is termed as reclamation ground. Land reclamation aims to increase areas for agriculture and settlement. The reclamation also aims to obtain land for industries and places for recreation. Further, the focus is also on improving transport systems on the land and waterways as well as controlling floods that might take place in an area. Nevertheless, land reclamation processes are expensive and may damage corals and marine life if not handled with great care. The reclaimed lands can also be vulnerable to natural hazards such as earthquakes because they are in most cases not as strong as naturally situated lands. In fact, the reclaimed land can easily sink when there is an earthquake. Erosion may also be severe in the reclaimed land because of the nature of the soil. Soil in the reclaimed land is not as compact as in the naturally situated land.",

        "page_content": "#### Methods used in land reclamation  \nMethods used for land reclamation depend on the nature, location, and size of the land to be reclaimed. For example, land may be reclaimed from water bodies, dry land, saline land, and swampy area.  \nThese different types of land require different methods of reclamation as elaborated below:  \n(a) Land affected by stagnant water or covered by water, draining techniques can be applied. The excess water is removed from the land by draining to make it useful for the intended purpose. An example of land reclamation by draining out water is the Zuider Zee Project in the Netherlands. In this project, dykes or high walls were built to enclose seawater and thus prevent it from entering the land. Then, the enclosed water was pumped out. The land obtained is regularly drained to remove salt for farming and settlement use.  \n(b) Reclamation of land affected by soil erosion differs from land covered by water. Soil affected by erosion calls for planting of trees. Trees will act as binding agents for keeping the soil particles together and absorbing excess water which would otherwise flow rapidly over the land. Moreover, using better methods of agriculture such as contour ploughing, terracing, and strip farming especially in steep slopes helps to prevent erosion.  \n(c) Land may also be reclaimed by restoring its fertility. In this case, land which has lost fertility may require planting cover crops and addition of organic manure and fertilisers to improve its fertility. The fertility will attract vegetation growth. Vegetation will not only bind the soil but also protect it from excessive loss of water through transpiration.  \n(d) Land affected by excessive animal keeping can be restored by reducing the number of animals in the area. This simple reclamation method allows the land to be proportionally used.  \n(e) Steep slopes may be reclaimed by leveling the land.",

The major reclamation projects have been carried out by the government through its agencies and international agencies. In particular, major reclamation projects have been carried out in Dodoma and Shinyanga regions. They are soil conservation programmes better known by their Kiswahili acronyms as HADO (Hifadhi Ardhi Dodoma) and HASHI (Hifadhi Ardhi Shinyanga).  \nThe HADO project was a large project implemented by the Government of Tanzania in 1973-1997, and was funded by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA). The main objective of the project was to conserve land and water, and rehabilitate the already depleted areas, particularly the severely affected Irangi Hills. The project strategies focused on promoting tree planting, bee-keeping, soil and water conservation, reclaiming degraded land, and local participation in conservation matters. The method of land reclamation involved the construction of terraces and cutting off drainage to check the speed of runoff water. However, the construction was not successful as grazing animals and uncontrolled runoff destroyed the barriers. HADO also involved uncontrolled livestock-keeping. As a result, huge gullies developed.  \nTherefore, to minimise the destruction of the barriers, about 85,000 animals (cattle, goats, sheep, and donkeys) were removed from the area. Afforestation was carried out to hold the soil and check the speed of runoff. The government stopped livestock from using these areas. The government through HADO campaigns also advised people interested in grazing to size down their livestock and try to practise zero-grazing. Significant gains have emerged from HADO initiatives.  \nGenerally, the land has been restored as soil fertility and vegetation in the worst degraded areas have gained a new lease of life. The areas which were no longer useful for supporting human activities have been transformed into potential farming areas also suitable for other nature dependent activities.",

It is a stock consisting of substances such as water, minerals, air, forestry resources or land. Water resources are essential and important assets for human beings. There are different types of water resources. These include fish, plantations, oil, natural gas, decoration materials, salt and some building materials. The seas and oceans possess mineral riches whose exploitation could be of great use to people. Exploitation of oil in Nigeria has made the country one of the stable countries in Africa in terms of economic development. The seas and oceans possess a wealth of minerals such as copper, manganese, nickel, cobalt and salt. Apart from vast oilfields, the continental shelves are rich in gas fields. All these water resources are of great use for the wellbeing of people in Africa.  \nWater resources are tapped using varying methods in different countries. Fishing is done using traditional as well as modern methods. Mwanza, Kigoma, Ruvuma, the coast of the Indian Ocean and Zanzibar are good examples of areas that exploit fish for domestic and industrial use. Japan is an excellent example of a country that exploits water resources through fish farming.  \nFish can be farmed and harvested in the same way as crops. Fish is carefully tamed in special areas and containers and harvested for domestic use. Other applicable methods depend on the scale of fishing. In many cases, small-scale fishing relies on the use of traditional methods as described below:  \nHand lining method: This consists of a long stick or rod and hook attached to a string. A bait is attached to the hook to attract fish. The fisherman sinks the hook into the water to catch the fish. The method is time-consuming.  \nTrap method: A trap is used where there is a flood or along the coast where there are tides. The traps are set up at the bank of a river or on beaches. The fish is washed onto the banks or beaches by water and as the water goes back, the fish remains trapped behind in the traps.  \nFish basket method: This method is used in shallow water lagoons and swamps, whereby a woven basket with an opening protruding inward is placed at the bottom of the water. A bait is placed inside the basket to attract fish. The fish enters the basket and fails to move back-Large-scale fishing is carried out in deep waters in the oceans and lakes. In Tanzania, large-scale fishing is practised in lake Victoria, Tanganyika, and Nyasa as well as in the Indian Ocean.  \nFigure 3.13 Fishing using a basket Source:thisisafrica.me  \nTrawling method: A trawl net is a big bag-shaped net whose mouth is kept open by boards. Its mouth has floats at the top and weights at the bottom to pull it down (Figure 3.14.) The net is pulled by a trawler. As the vessel moves. the fish is caught in the open mouth of the trawler net. When sufficient amounts of fish have been trapped the vessel stops and the net is pulled into the boat.",

Polluted water affects marine animals such as fish and planktons.\n(ii) Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has resulted in some fish species disappearing.\n(iii) Poor methods of quarrying for building materials has led to further land degradation of shores in addition to the destruction of fish breeding areas and coral reefs.\n(iv) Excessive exploitation of marine life does not only lead to loss of life but also reduces the amount of fish, cuts down breeding capacity and replacement capacity of other species.\n(v) Pollution of water, apart from affecting the life of fish, may also damage the near shore marine environment.\n(vi) Pollution from industrial activities as is the case with oil drilling regions of the Niger Delta has resulted in damage to the environment in nearby shores.\n(vii) When fresh water resources become saline, they can no longer be used for irrigation or drinking. Saline water is toxic to plants, and high sodium levels cause dry soils to become hard and compact and reduce their ability to absorb water. Ground water extraction and irrigation can increase salt concentrations in water. Irrigation can also cause salinization by raising the water table and lifting saline ground water near the surface into the root zone. This occurs when irrigation efficiency is poor, so a large fraction of irrigation water infiltrates into the soil, and groundwater flow is slow.

The water may be polluted through discharging waste in it or mixing it with chemicals usually from factories and industries. Besides, water pollution is also caused by domestic practices especially channelling toilet waste into water streams. All the materials which pollute water are called pollutants. Water pollution is at times caused by the construction of latrines directly in the ground. This way of pollution affects mostly underground water. The latrines tend to seep wastes into the underground water. Many homes and industries with no access to sewerage systems rely on shallow underground disposal of waste.  \nThis way of waste disposal contaminates shallow wells which may cause water-borne diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea and typhoid. Shallow wells are mostly the source of water for domestic use in many communities, especially those which have no formal water supply from authorised dealers.  \nTransportation and storage of materials which may spill and leak is another source of underground water pollution. For example, chemicals used in manufacturing, processing and construction industries sometimes are not transported and stored by observing any specified handling precautions. This leads to spillage and leakage to the ground and, consequently, seepage into the soil which pollutes underground water through infiltration.  \nFurthermore, underground water is at times polluted by human activities in their effort to use the land to earn a livelihood. Experience shows that modern farming is characterised by the use of fertilisers, herbicides, insecticides and pesticides. The misuse of these chemicals in farming harms the soil and once rain falls the chemicals contaminate the underground water through infiltration.  \nUnderground water can also be polluted naturally through volcanic eruption. This occurs in areas characterised by eruption of poisonous volcanic materials from the interior of the Earth. The erupted materials finally seep into the soil and mix with underground water. Generally, pollution of underground water is harmful to the lives of people and other living organisms, which directly or indirectly use the water.",

By 2015, it was estimated that forests covered about 31% of the earth\u2019s surface. Forest distribution on the earth\u2019s surface varies. Such variation is caused by the amount of rainfall available and the length of wet and warm seasons per year. Forests can be absent in some areas even where the climatic conditions allow tree growth. Absence of forests in extensive areas can be caused by actions of human beings and wild animals.  \nHuman beings obtain various products and services from forests. Forest products can be timber and non-timber products that help to sustain human life. Non-timber forest products include fruits, honey, leaves, roots and barks. The process of managing forest resources for human use is known as forestry. Foresters engage in lumbering, which is an activity that involves cutting, transporting, processing and selling timber. The terms \u2018timber\u2019 and \u2018log\u2019 are used interchangeably to mean branches or pieces of the trunk of a tree, but with the bark attached. Harvesting of forest resources is generally sustainable when there is no or little damage to the general environment. A forest can be natural or planted. Animals, birds and insects use forests to support their lives. Forests provide aesthetic value and services to human beings.",

The difference in growth may cause them to be harvested at different periods. In addition, the difference in the harvesting of trees in planted forests may be caused by a system of planting trees in blocks.  \nPlanted forests are regularly cleaned by removing unwanted undergrowth, which may hinder the healthy growth of the planted species.

        "page_content": "#### Factors influencing distribution of forests  \nThe distribution of forests on the earth\u2019s surface depends on many factors. The common ones are temperature, rainfall, relief, soil, drainage and aspect.  \nTemperature: Temperature is a notable factor influencing the distribution of forests. Different plants require different temperature ranges. Temperature limits the growth of trees, thus leading to shallow forests or no forest at all. Areas that are hot and humid such as the equatorial region encourage the growth of large trees with broad leaves. Cooler temperate climates that experience snowfalls support coniferous type of trees that can withstand low temperatures and freezing conditions.  \nRainfall: The distribution of forests is also influenced by rainfall. Forests thrive well in areas with plenty of rainfall of over 1200 mm throughout the year. The dense equatorial forests have thrived well because of the presence of heavy rainfall that is well distributed throughout the year. In deciduous forest regions, trees that can survive the dry season exist. These trees shed their leaves during the dry season to reduce water loss through transpiration as their means of survival. Relief is another factor that influences the distribution of forests. It determines soil, temperature and vegetation distribution across gradient. Tree distribution varies with altitude. For example, on Mount Kilimanjaro at 1800-3000 m above sea level, forests consist of diverse tree species. At higher altitude (3000 m), alpine heath dominate. Thus, differences in relief are associated with variations in the type of forests.  \nSoil: Soil contributes much to the distribution of forests. In this case, soil type, drainage, texture, permeability, porosity and chemical composition play a significant role in tree growth. For example, soil rich in humus encourages tree growth, which may turn into a forest. Regarding drainage, well-drained soils support a variety of trees whereas poorly drained soils such as swamps or steep slope areas with immature soil cannot support tree growth. For example, coastal tropical areas with sea alluvial salty water attract mangrove forests growth. Also, tropical rainforest trees require deep well-drained soils for proper binding together whereas coniferous trees have fibrous roots which can grow in shallow soils.  \nAspect: Aspect refers to the position of a place in relation to the sun. The influence of aspect on tree growth is well noted in temperate latitudes. In the Northern Hemisphere, the south-facing slopes are warmer than the north-facing slopes. In the Southern Hemisphere, on the other hand, the south facing slopes are cooler than the north facing slopes. Trees need temperature and rainfall as important elements for their growth. Therefore, in the Northern Hemisphere the south facing slopes tend to have more dense forests compared to the north-facing slopes.  \nHuman activities: Forest distribution can also be influenced by human activities in different ways. For example, cultivation, herding and mining contribute to the disappearance of forests. Indeed, large-scale agriculture requires the clearance of large areas of forests. In the meantime, industrial demand for hard and soft wood necessitates people to increase the size of planted forests. Extensive planted forests in Tanzania are found at Sao Hill in Iringa and Kawetere in Mbeya.",

        "page_content": "#### Importance of forest resources  \nForests have significant contribution to social, economic and ecological development. They provide various products for human use such as timber, poles, wood, logs, leaves, roots and honey.  \nSource of income: Forest products are sold in the country or exported to earn income. It is common for products such as timber, rubber, wood and poles to be exported to earn foreign currency. Likewise, forests make up 22.2% of household incomes in developing countries. The main forest products that contribute to incomes are fuel wood, building poles, timber and building materials.  \nPaper-based materials: Logs are processed to make different types of paper. Also some trees have tissues which are processed to make glue commonly known as wood-glue.  \nSource of energy: Forests provide firewood and charcoal which are used as sources of energy in the households. Wood energy provides 9% of the global primary energy supply, making it the most important source of bioenergy in the world. In some parts of Africa, fuel wood is the most affordable source of energy and it accounts for about 90% of primary energy consumption.  \nEmployment: Individuals are employed in the forestry sector as forest officers and forest guards. Others are employed as lumberers while some are self-employed in carpentry and joinery, and others are timber merchants who buy and sell timber. Forest industries provide formal employment to 0.4% of the global labour force, contributing to nearly 1% of global GDP in 2008.  \nMedicinal value: Some forest trees have medicinal value. They have roots, leaves, and bark which are used as medicine or processed to make medicine for human beings and animals. For example, the bark of the cinchona tree is used in manufacturing quinine which is useful for treatment of malaria. Also, some trees are used in making herbicides for use in agriculture.  \nTourist attraction: Some forests have rare and unique species of animals and plants which attract people to observe. For example, Gombe Forests in Kigoma have chimpanzees, which are a great attraction for both local and foreign tourists. Many of the natural parks have forests that serve as habitats for attracting animals and plants.  \nRainfall formation: Areas with heavy forests are characterised by frequent rainfall. For example, in the Amazon forests, 30 percent of rainfall is said to be influenced by moist air from trees.",

Ecological and environmental balance is the mutual symbiotic system or state in which plants and animals benefit from each other, thus maintaining their survival in the environment. Plants, insects and animals live together in a particular environment. They live a symbiotic relationship by benefiting from each other. The specific roles forests play in fostering ecological and environmental balance are as elaborated in the paragraphs that follow:  \nDuring photosynthesis, oxygen is released by plants into the environment through the stomata, and this is used by animals. At the same time animals release carbon dioxide that is absorbed by the plants. By doing so, a balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide in the environment is maintained. Forests provide suitable habitats for wildlife and, therefore, contribute to the balance of ecosystem. Various animals live in the forest which gives them shelter and food as they eat leaves, roots and fruits. Moreover, forests help to control soil erosion as they protect the soil from being eroded by blowing wind and running water. Trees in the forest bind together the soil particles using roots, and reduce the impact of raindrops with the same roots. Plant leaves reduce the impact of rain drops on the soil and reduce excessive evaporation of soil water.  \nAlso, the remains of forest trees including foliage contribute to soil development through decomposition into organic matter, leading to formation of humus. Soil in the forest is very fertile due to humus from decomposed plant remains. Solar energy helps plants to manufacture their own food through photosynthesis. Plants are eaten by herbivores; likewise, herbivores are consumed by carnivores who feed on meat. When they all die, their remains are decomposed by bacteria which break down dead matter and release nutrients into the soil. Therefore, forests have input in the food chain. Tree canopies control the evaporation of water from the soil beneath, hence allow more retention of water in the soil. The canopies also enable recharging of ground water by controlling over land flow after rainfall. In addition, forest trees contribute to water vapour in the atmosphere which is important in regulating atmospheric conditions. The humidity in the atmosphere is important in the rain formation process.",

It is considered relatively cheaper compared to other means of transportation. In Brazil and Mexico well connected networks of railways and roads are widely used as means of transportation of logs. In Russia, the trans-Siberia railway line is used for such transportation. Figure 4.8 shows logs floating in the Angara River on the way to downstream ports. In Asian countries, especially Myanmar (formerly Burma), logs are pulled to the edge of water bodies by elephants or tractors. Then, the logs are floated downstream during the rainy season.  \nFigure 4.8 Transporting timber using the Angara River, Russia\nSource: https://www.robertharding.com/preview/869-10/forestry-trees-transport-logs-river/  \nHeavy greenheart logs are transported by road. Later they are transported to river banks where they are loaded into pontoons and ferries. In the dense network of streams and major rivers in the Amazon and Congo basins, waterways have not sufficiently been utilised to transport logs. This leads to frequent stoppage of logs at difficult spots. In addition, the weight of huge logs make floating in rivers difficult. Rapids and falls interrupt these rivers, making floating of logs impossible. The scattered distribution of the most valuable trees complicates even further the river transportation of logs.",

However, transportation of timber faces a number of challenges.  \nThe countries that depend on floating logs in water as the main means of transport, face challenges to transport heavy logs. Timber transportation may also pose a challenge especially when forests are located in remote areas away from market centers. In fact, this situation increases the transportation cost for harvested forest resources. For example, in the equatorial rainforest, forests are dense and located in hardly accessible areas and, therefore, making it difficult to transport logs to the processing areas. Seasonal variation of water in rivers is also a challenge for timber transportation. Water in rivers fluctuate seasonally. During the dry season, the volume of water decreases whereas during the rainy season the volume increases. In this case, the reduction in the volume of water in the rivers hinders the transportation of logs to the processing industries. Similarly undeveloped means of transportation also pose challenges in timber transportation from the forest to the processing centers, by road and railway.",

        "page_content": "### Challenges facing the forestry industry  \nAlthough forest resources contribute to the welfare of people, the forestry industry faces numerous challenges. Over-exploitation of forest resources is one of the challenges. Forest resources are harvested to the point of reducing their ability to regenerate. For example, some forest tree species, especially natural trees, are usually in high demand. The demand compels over-harvesting of such forest resources so much so that they face extinction. In some cases, forests are harvested without following governing procedures and, consequently, some tree species may disappear. Experience indicates that ungoverned exploitation is usually serious in public-owned natural forests than in private planted forests. Forests also face the problem of fire outbreaks with some fires occurring naturally while others are set by people. The fire, particularly during late burning, destroys trees and the undergrowth, which are the main constituents of forests. Estimates indicate that each year fires burn 6-14 million hectares of forests around the world. Construction of different infrastructure for social and economic support is a challenge to the forestry industry. Different construction activities lead to the devastation of forests. For example, the construction of dams, roads and railway lines forces the clearing of some forest hectares. In addition, population increase presents another challenge to the forestry industry. As the population increases, more space for human settlement and life support is required. As a result, people tend to invade the forests and clear them for settlements, farming, charcoal burning and firewood fetching. Then there is the challenge of global warming. Global warming results from the accumulation of harmful gases in the atmosphere. In this case, the gases destroy the ozone layer and makes some trees in the forest wither and dry after failing to withstand the situation. Similarly, deforestation is a challenge to the forests. It exposes the soil, which was once protected by the forest cover, hence making it vulnerable to the agents of soil erosion such as wind, rainfall and water runoff. The resultant erosion affects the quality of the soil which loses its fertility, and limits the growth of trees.  \nDestruction of animal habitats is also a challenge to the forestry industry. Cutting down, burning and over-exploitation of trees destroy the homes of animals and soil organisms. Some animals may migrate to other less favourable and inhospitable areas only to die there. This act may lead to forest extinction due to the absence of animals and other organisms that matter to the eco-system by keeping the forest soil fertile. Besides, destroying forest habitats may lead to scarcity of forest products such as trees of medicinal value, and honey.",

        "page_content": "### Addressing challenges facing forest resources  \nAlthough forests continually face a number of challenges across the world, countries have been making concerted efforts to find lasting solutions to these challenges. Simply put, deforested area should be reforested. Reforestation is the establishment of a forest through planting trees in an area where plant cover was destroyed through careless felling of trees. A reforestation programme that has been implemented in Tanzania is the Management of Natural Resources Programme funded by the Governments of Norway and Tanzania. The programme was implemented by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism (MNRT) between July 2002-June 2006. The objective of the programme was to increase benefits to rural communities based on sustainable natural resource management in Tanzania. The outcomes of the programme were to:  \n- improve the quality of forests in all project regions: the number and intensity of fires have decreased significantly, woody vegetation, and canopy cover have increased, and the quantity and quality of water has improved;\n- enhance the regeneration of vegetation in degraded areas around Karatu villages; and\n- inculcate the culture of tree planting in some areas, particularly in Ruvu, which has enabled trees to be planted in people\u2019s farms.  \nFurthermore, there are two projects with a component of planting trees. These are Hifadhi Ardhi Shinyanga (HASHI) and Hifadhi Ardhi Dodoma (HADO) Improving tree harvesting practises in the forest as an appropriate mechanism for ensuring the trees are not depleted is important. Such eco-friendly practises include selective cutting of trees where only mature or weak (i.e. diseased trees) are removed. Selective cutting is practised in many countries including Tanzania, Southern USA, Finland and Sweden. This selective tree cutting ensures that enough trees are left to grow.  \nMoreover, forests must be protected from natural hazards such as fire and pests through close supervision and use of watch towers and air patrol. In the USA and Canada, an early sign of fire outbreak can be reported and addressed immediately. Fire can also be controlled through creating fire-breaks. Insects and pests must be prevented by regular inspection and spraying. Furthermore, it is also important to set preventive measures such as laws, regulations and creation of public awareness. Laws are to be enforced to prevent uncontrolled harvesting of trees. In Kilimanjaro Region, no trees for timber can be cut without permission from local government authorities. Forest guards also patrol forest areas.  \nIn East Africa, forest guards receive training at forest training institutes such as Olmotonyi in Tanzania, Nakuru in Kenya and Uganda Forest School in Uganda. Regarding public awareness, people have to be educated on the importance of forest conservation. This awareness creation should extend to persuading people to participate fully in all activities involving the protection of forests. This may be done through the mass media such as radio, television and public meetings. Multiple uses of forest and forest products may also act as a measure for overcoming some of the forestry industry challenges. This is a practice whereby some species used for timber marketing could be used for extracting tannin and those used for the extraction of tannin could be used as a source of hardwood.  \nThe practise is well established in developed countries such as the USA where old rubber trees could also be used for other purposes.  \nIn Tanzania, forests serve as water catchment areas, which in turn enhance forest management. Alongside multiple uses, re-use and recycling of waste papers can also serve as a measure for forest conservation. It is also advisable to recycle used paper into other products or re-use it for other purposes. This may reducts cutting trees for paper-making. Products such as egg trays, packaging boxes, toilet paper and newsprints can be made from recycled paper products. In addition, alternative sources of energy may be opted to reduce the speed of use of forest resources. For example, the use of alternative sources of energy such as solar energy, biogas, hydroelectric power, natural gas, instead of fuel wood and charcoal reduces pressure on the use of forest resources.  \nIn Tanzania, the government puts emphasis on the use of alternative energy, especially for domestic use. It also stresses the use of recycled paper charcoal instead of charcoal made from trees. In addition, there has been an increase in the use of solar power, especially where there is no power.",

The extracted materials may be minerals, fossil fuels, and other geological materials. However, not all geological substances are categorized as minerals. In science, a mineral has specific characteristics such as being solid, inorganic, naturally occurring, has definite chemical composition and ordered internal structure. Although oil, coal and natural gas do not possess most of these characteristics, they may be categorized as minerals. From a non-scientific view, a mineral refers to a non-living naturally occurring resource from the earth. As such, oil, coal, and natural gas also qualify to be called mineral resources. Thus, petroleum and natural gas which are discussed as case studies in this chapter are treated as minerals. Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water.  \nThere are two main types of mining, namely, surface and underground mining. Minerals such as salts are found close to the earth surface; as such, open cast method of mining is used to exploit them. Other minerals like gold and diamond are found deep in the ground, hence undergound mining methods are used to obtain them.  \nThe world is full of different types of minerals. Minerals can be classified into five main groups, that is, rocks used as building stones, and for brick making; non-metallic minerals such as salt, sulphur, nitrates, and asbestos; metals like gold, iron, and silver; mineral fuels including coal, petroleum and gas; and water. The whole of the earth, therefore, is full of minerals which are of great value to human beings.",

These are veins and lodes, bed and seams, weathering products, and alluvial or place deposits. Veins and lodes are formed when molten materials containing minerals intrude and solidify into cracks and crevices. These are mainly associated with igneous and metamorphic intrusions. Examples of minerals formed in veins and lodes are tin, copper, silver, lead, manganese and zinc.  \nBed and seams constitute another type of mineral formation. Coal, iron ore, gypsum, potash, salts and common salts are formed as a direct result of deposition, accumulation and concentration in the horizontal strata of the earth\u2019s crust. Gypsum, potash and salts, for example, are formed by the evaporation of lakes in desert areas and later are covered by other deposits so that they appear as seams.  \nBauxite, the ore of aluminium is formed by the deep weathering of a variety of rocks. Leaching by underground water produces red lateric deposits which are iron concentrations found in many tropical soils. Many minerals such as gold, tin and platinum are found as alluvial deposits in mud, gravel and sands of alluvial fans at the base of hills or bottoms of valleys.",

The distribution of minerals depends on geological processes which have taken place over a long period of time. The availability of minerals may resemble or differ from country to country or region to region, within the same country. Tanzania is one of the countries in the world that are rich in minerals. It is established that Tanzania has almost all types of minerals which are found in other parts of the world.  \nDiamond, gold, iron, coal, gypsum, copper, uranium, mica, graphite, tin and tanzanite are some of the minerals found in Tanzania. Figure 5.1 shows the distribution of various minerals in Tanzania. Tanzanite is a gemstone only found in Tanzania. Other minerals found in Tanzania are nickel, salt, asbestos, silver, titanium, lead, zinc, platinum, bauxite, soda ash, lime phosphate, sand and natural gas.  \nMinerals are also found in other countries on all continents of the world. For example, copper is found in Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), South Africa, Uganda, United States of America (USA) and Canada. Diamond is found in Botswana, Ghana, DRC, Canada, Brazil, Russia and Australia. Iron is found in Mauritania, Liberia and Canada. Coal is found in Russia, South Africa and Zambia.

        "page_content": "#### Uses of some minerals  \nMinerals are used for different purposes. This part explains the uses of eight minerals. These minerals are tanzanite, copper, diamond, gold, iron, coal, petroleum and natural gas.  \n##### Tanzanite:  \nTanzanite is the blue and violet of the mineral ziosite caused by small amounts of vanadium, belonging to the epidote group. Tanzanite is only found in Tanzania in a very small mining area approximately 7 km near Mererani Hills in Arusha. It was discovered in 1967.  \nTanzanite is noted for its remarkably strong trichoism, appearing alternately as blue, violet and burgundy depending on crystal orientation. Tanzanite can also appear differently when viewed under different lighting conditions.  \nFigure 5.1 Distribution of minerals in Tanzania  \nFigure 5.2 Distribution of some major minerals in the world  \nThe gemstone was named \u2018tanzanite\u2019 by Tiffany and Company, after Tanzania, the country in which it was discovered. It is used in making bracelets, necklaces and earrings.  \n##### Copper:  \nCopper is one of the most widely used industrial metals because it is a good conductor of heat and electricity. Copper is also very resistant to atmospheric corrosion; therefore, it is useful in the transmission of electricity. Copper is used in making alloys since it combines easily with other metals to produce new compounds. For example, copper combines with zinc to produce bronze which is used in making coins, ornaments and utensils. It is also used in making electronic and telecommunication appliances such as sockets, holders, connectors and parts of mobile phones. These appliances are useful in industries and homes. In addition, copper is used in making corrosion-resistant materials for roofing, tubes, pipes, radiators and boilers.  \n##### Diamond:  \nDiamond is a rare and the hardest naturally occurring mineral composed of pure carbon. It occurs commonly in rocks called kimberlite. It is used in glass cutting. Glass dealers use it to cut and sharpen glass into different shapes and sizes. Besides, the dust diamond is used for polishing other gemstone minerals such as tanzanite.  \nMoreover, diamond is used in making jewels and ornaments which are used as decorations in homes, offices, hotels and other public places. It is also used in making bits for drilling purposes and during oil and gas extraction.  \n##### Gold:  \nGold is one of the most valuable minerals in the world. Gold is able to conduct both electricity and heat easily. It does not lose its colour and brilliancy. It is useful in making jewels and ornaments. Gold is also used to make necklaces, and ear, arm and finger rings. Jewels and ornaments made of gold are usually expensive compared to most of the jewels and ornaments made from other minerals. The mineral is used in making valuable decorations for households, offices, hotels, places of worship such as churches, temples, synagogues and mosques. It is also used in making electronic appliances such as connectors and switches. Sometimes, gold is used in making gold coins. Some precious coins made of gold are used as currency. Other uses include making gold alloys for filling teeth gaps as well as medals, placards and trophies. Famous people in the world receive gold medals as recognition for their outstanding performance.  \n##### Iron:  \nIron is a basic raw material for iron and steel industries. When iron ore is smelt, iron metal is formed. Iron is used in making roofing materials and hardboards for vehicles, ferries and boats. It is also used in making machines, especially for heavy industries. Most of the parts in cars, vehicles and milling machines are made of iron. Furthermore, iron is used in making agricultural equipment such as hand-hoes, oxen ploughs, power tillers and tractors. Other uses of iron include the production of building and construction materials. Iron-bars are useful in the construction and building of physical structures such as houses, railways, bridges and roads. Iron is also useful in designing fencing materials for security purposes. For example, people use iron-made fences to demarcate houses and plots and for providing security. Apart from that, iron is used for making tools that are useful in cutting and grinding other metals.  \n##### Coal:  \nCoal is a black or brownish-black rock made of organic substances that have been deposited for a long period. The most significant uses of coal are in electricity generation, steel production, cement manufacturing and as a liquid fuel. A number of manufacturing industries use coal to run machines. For example, in Tanzania, coal from Mbinga and Kiwira is used as a source of energy in cement production industries. In addition, the carbon present in coal is an important element when mixed with other chemicals in paper, ink and pencil-making. The carbon in coal is also an ingredient used in drugs and chemical production. For example, aspirin contains some percentages of carbon from coal. Coal is also used in the production of valuable fertilisers that are used in agriculture. Some coal products are useful in making soap, solvents and plastic fibres such as rayon and nylon used for making clothes. Other uses of coal include making construction materials, particularly when it is mixed with cement, gravel and water to form concrete which is a basic building element in various infrastructures. China is the leading coal producer in the world.  \n##### Petroleum and natural gas:  \nPetroleum and natural gas are in most cases related in occurrence. They are both products of animal and plant remains that have decomposed for a long time, usually billions of years. They appear naturally below the earth\u2019s surface and are both fossil fuels. Whereas petroleum is a liquid substance, natural gas is a non-liquid substance. Petroleum and natural gas are in high demand in the world because of their large contribution to power and energy generation for domestic, automobile, and industrial use.  \nIn Tanzania, natural gas is found in the southern parts of the country, particularly in Mtwara, Lindi, and Ruvuma regions. Specifically, natural gas is produced at Songosongo, Mnazi Bay, Msimbati, Kiliwani North, and Ntorya. Furthermore, exploration of natural gas and petroleum is going on in Tanzania and there are signs of their availability in other coastal regions and islands of Tanzania. In recent years, the exploration has indicated the availability of petroleum and natural gas in Pemba \u2013 Zanzibar.  \nThe major producers of petroleum and natural gas in the world include USA, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Russia, Nigeria, Gabon, Libya, Kuwait, Algeria, Angola, Venezuela, Mexico, and Egypt.  \nPetroleum and natural gas are used for different purposes in different sectors. Both minerals are sources of power generation. The power generated is used to run machines and engines. For example, most industrial machines, motor-vehicle engines, and generators use petroleum or gas to operate. Crude petroleum is a raw material for producing various products such as kerosene, diesel, petrol, oil and bitumen. Some by-products of petroleum are useful in chemical industries for manufacturing several products such as jelly, synthetic fibres, grease and other lubricants. In addition, petroleum wastes from refineries are used for road surfacing and wood treatment against damage and attack by insects. Natural gas is used for domestic purposes such as heating and cooking. For example, in recent years, Tanzanians have been good users of natural gas for cooking using gas stoves and gas cookers.  \n##### Other important minerals:  \nOther important minerals include mineral salt produced in Tanzania and China; phosphate mined in Tanzania, Uganda, Togo, and South Africa; tin mined in DRC, Nigeria, Rwanda, Burundi, and Niger; bauxite in Guinea, Ghana, Jamaica, and USA; and manganese mined in Gabon, Ghana, DRC, Ivory Coast, Angola, and Zambia. Minerals such as stones, gravel, and sand are found almost everywhere around the globe. These minerals have various uses in different sectors. For example, stones, gravel, and sand are used in the construction industry.",

Techniques of surface mining include: open-pit mining or open cast mining, which is the recovery of materials from an open pit in the ground; and quarrying, identical to open-pit mining except that it refers to sand, stone and clay. Open cast mining is the cheapest method of extracting minerals. This method is used to extract minerals which usually occur close to the earth\u2019s surface. This method involves removing the top layers of the earth and other overlying materials above the mineral ores. Figure 5.3 shows an open cast mine. The extraction involves the use of earth moving machines and bulldozers, and electric shovels. Sometimes explosion is used to blow overlying materials in order to reach the ore beneath. This method is cheaper because the output is bigger than the costs of running. The open cast method is used to extract quarrying limestone, coal, and other surface minerals.",

        "page_content": "### Contribution of the mining industry to the economy of Tanzania:  \nMinerals are useful in the growth of any country\u2019s economy. Some minerals have more demand than others due to their high value. Minerals are used in countries where they are produced and also they are exported to various countries to obtain foreign currency. The contribution of mining industries to the Tanzanian economy include the following:  \n- Government revenue: The mining industry contributes to government revenue in terms of taxes and royalties. This is crucial for financing developmental plans of the country.\n- Employment: The mining industry contributes direct and indirect employment opportunities within the country. Some people get employed directly in the industry while others provide services related to mining in mining centers.\n- National gross domestic product: The mining industry contributes to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). For example, mining and quarrying activities in Tanzania contributed about 4% to its GDP in 2015.\n- Raw materials: Minerals provide raw materials for various industries. For example, gypsum is used as a raw material in cement industries.\n- Social services: Mining stimulates the development of settlements. The establishment of settlements in or near mining centers forces the government to provide social services such as health, and education. In addition, the development of settlements around mining centers has contributed to the growth of some towns such as Mwadui, Kahama, Geita, and Mererani.\n- Infrastructure: Mining stimulates the construction of roads to and from mining centers. For example, Kahama road networks were constructed due to gold mining. Similarly, Mwadui roads were built because of diamond mining.\n- Effects of the mining industry on the environment: Mining and processing activities have negative effects on the environment if not done carefully. The sections below describe some of the effects of mining on the environment.\n- Pollution: Mining activities can lead to water, air, and noise pollution. To begin with, mining produces waste materials which pollute water bodies. For example, chemicals used in processing minerals such as mercury and sodium cyanide can pollute rivers, lakes, and underground water. This may cause the loss of life of living organisms, which depend on water. Large amounts of dust released into the air affect people, plants, and animals found in nearby areas. Also, the blasting process causes noise and vibration which affect people and their properties in nearby areas.\n- Land degradation: Mining causes pits on the earp\u2019s surface. When mining is done on a large-scale, the destruction of the surrounding land is higher. Open cast mines produce much larger quantities of waste pan underground mines. These open-pit mines produce 8 to 10 times as much waste as underground mines. In some areas, breaking of rocks may cause landslides on nearby land. Landslides can damage transport routes and nearby property.\n- Destruction of land surface appearance: This may happen in areas where there are no more minerals and mining activities have stopped, and land left without being reclaimed. In the case of the open-cast method of mining, land appearance is destroyed, deep holes are left on the earth\u2019s surface, creating problems related to soil erosion, health, and death. If the holes are filled with water, they become breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which may spread malaria.\n- Deforestation and loss of biodiversity: Large-scale mining involves clearing of forests and any other vegetation cover. The clearance of vegetation causes the loss of different plant and animal species. Mining causes direct and indirect damage to wild animals by altering their habitats. This may lead to the disappearance of various wildlife species such as birds and other animals.\n- Loss of soil productivity: Rocky soils left behind after mining cannot support crop production because they have low fertility. In fact, the soil structure and texture is destroyed when it mixes with particles of rocks.\n- Effects on the water table: Deep mining that reaches the water table may cause underground water to flood the mines. As a result, the water has to be pumped out to allow mining to continue. Continued pumping of this underground water lowers the water table of the area.",

Planting trees and other vegetation cover helps to repair the damaged land.\n- Proper storage and use of chemicals: It is advisable to store chemicals in a strong room so that no leakage occurs into the soil and water. Moreover, chemicals are to be used with care to avoid polluting soil and water resources.\n- Waste management: There must be a proper waste disposal from mineral processing industries. This organised disposal includes treatment of the chemicals that flow from the industries into rivers and streams. In addition, there should be dust management programmes to avoid air pollution.\n- Safety education: Mining companies are required to provide safety education to workers and the communities surrounding the mining areas. Such education may include wearing of protective gear (helmets, gloves, overalls, glasses and masks). This protects the workers from accidents associated with mining activities. The community has to be educated on the importance of reporting any environmental problem they experience as a result of mining activities.\n- Mining regulations: The government should enforce mining and environmental laws and regulations that guide mining and mineral processing activities, to reduce the negative effects of mining.",

With rising global demand, highly volatile prices are increasingly becoming stringent. The oil and gas industry faces three major challenges involving how to reduce costs, optimize the performance of its industrial base assets, and address its environmental footprint. Environmental pollution is one of these challenges. Oil refinery and production of petroleum products produce carbon dioxide and other gases such as methane which are harmful. As countries in the Middle East have large oil production industries, the emission of harmful gases is also high. These gases contribute to the pollution of water, air, and land. Burning fossil fuels produces sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. When they move into the atmosphere they produce acid rain, which damages buildings and vegetation in addition to affecting fish and other organisms that live in water. Another challenge facing oil production in the Middle East has to do with civil wars and social violence. Producing crude oil and refined products at a lower cost to stay competitive on the market is one of the major challenges.",

For example, the discovery and extraction of gas in Mtwara Region has stimulated improvement of the airport and the harbour in the region. As a result, air transport to and from Mtwara Region has also improved. Natural gas has also created the demand for labour, goods and services. There has been an increase in the demand for both skilled and unskilled labour to work in the mines and carry out mining-related activities. Moreover, natural gas extraction has added a source of income for the people. Companies involved in natural gas extraction usually pay taxes and other dues to the government. People living nearby natural gas extraction fields also benefit by selling goods, especially agricultural products to the mining community. People surrounding the mining areas also benefit from the social services such as schools, water and hospitals built to support the mining community.

These factors are features that encourage tourists to visit places for leisure, pleasure or education.  \n- Tourist attractions: Tourist attractions include places with pleasant climate, beautiful and varied sceneries, different cultures, historical sites and monuments. Also, some features in Tanzania such as Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest free-standing mountain in the world, attract tourists.\n- Advancement in communication and transportation network: Reliable communication network and advanced technology encourage the development of tourism in a country. For example, the use of the internet, television programmes, and social media, tourism trade fair and exhibitions has facilitated availability of information on tourism, hence it has led to an influx of tourists.\n- Good infrastructure: Presence of good infrastructure that makes a place easily accessible at affordable rates by car, train, bus, water and air helps to attract tourists. For example, air transport has shortened the time that a tourist spends for travelling to and from Tanzania and other parts of the world.\n- Good accommodation: Presence of adequate, comfortable and affordable hotels, camp sites and resorts attracts tourists. For example, in Tanzania, the presence of accommodation facilities which cater for tourists of varied economic status is one of the factors that attract tourists.\n- Peace and stability: Peace and stability in any country encourage the growth of the tourism sector. Tourists prefer to visit places with assured peace and security. Moreover, countries with political instability discourage tourism due to fear of war, violence and terrorist attacks, for example, Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Somalia.\n- Good hospitality: Tourists prefer to visit places where people are honest, generous and with hospitality. In fact, the tourism industry is more developed in various parts of the world where emphasis has been placed on training personnel to master hospitality skills.\n- Marketing: Countries with good marketing strategies also have the potential of attracting a great number of tourists. Marketing the tourism industry helps to communicate information about various attraction centers, hence calling for more visitors. Some of the marketing strategies include the use of diplomatic missions abroad such as embassies, high commissions and consulates, the mass media, special tourism envoys and advertisements during international exhibitions.\n- Importance of tourism in the world: Tourism contributes to the socio-economic development of the country. The tourism industry employs many people directly and indirectly, for example, hotel staff, tour guides, porters, drivers and airline staff. Others include those employed in the manufacturing of goods such as postcards, souvenirs and local handicrafts. Tourists prefer and are encouraged to visit countries with which they have diplomatic relationship because this is one way of promoting cultural exchange to enhance international understanding and foster collective solving of global problems. People from different nationalities also learn to appreciate other cultures, hence promote cultural tolerance. Generally, governments are committed to conserving tourist attractions because tourists are attracted by the presence of historical and cultural sites, and wildlife. In Tanzania, the government also promotes sustainable conservation of the sites and national parks to ensure the growth of the tourism sector.  \nTourism services also generate the much-needed foreign currency. Tourists arrive in the country with convertible currencies which boost the country\u2019s foreign currency. Moreover, taxes from this sector contribute to the growth of the national economy. This, in turn, lead to the development of other sectors such as health, education, infrastructure and water. Furthermore, existing roads are improved and new ones are built to connect tourist attraction sites. Airports are also developed and improved. Communication infrastructure is also improved to serve these areas.",

The development and expansion of international tourism has led to the creation of various job opportunities. Similarly, the tourism industry has led to job creation in rural areas, thereby reducing levels of rural-urban migration. An example can be cited from the area around Mount Kilimanjaro and Arusha in Tanzania where people secure jobs as porters, translators and guides on a sustainable basis.  \nAs a result, both skilled and unskilled personnel find employment in the sector as well as the hospitality industry; hence they improve their standards of living.\nAlso, roads, railways, airports and hotels, are attractively constructed and maintained to sustain the tourism industry. For example, transport means to tourist attraction centers in Tanzania such as the Serengeti, Mikumi, and Mount Kilimanjaro national parks as well as Bagamoyo historical sites are well developed. Tourism has also encouraged increase in production in other sectors to meet the tourist needs. For example, other sectors such as transport, agriculture, trade and commerce are highly favoured.",

Moral decay has occurred in places that are visited by tourists. For example, cases of prostitution, same-sex relationships (homosexuality), and drug abuse have become common in areas with tourist attractions such as beaches and nightclubs.  \nIn addition, tourist activities in national parks and other protected areas may lead to environmental degradation such as off road driving and dumping of waste such as paper and plastics.  \nMoreover, the continued presence of people and vehicles in the tourists sites may lead to change in animal behaviours.",

For example, the Alps Mountains occupy about 60% of the total land. This offers a variety of scenery which comprises snow peaks, lakes, forested areas and glaciers. Switzerland is bordered by Austria, France, Germany, Italy, and Liechtenstein. Tourism in Switzerland takes place in the summer months of July - September when it is easy to view the snow-capped mountain peaks, clear blue skies and cascading waterfalls. Winter months are decorated by abundant snow on mountain slopes for skiing and ice-skating.  \nThe most frequently visited areas during the summer are the Swiss Plateau of Lausanne, Geneva, Bern, Zurich and lake shores. Other places are Ticino Mountain with towns like Lucerne and Lugano. Switzerland is referred to as the playground of the world because most of its fame comes from its tourism industry.

Also, its slopes have abundant snow which attracts tourists interested in skiing and ice-skating. Others are hills, plateaux, plains, large lakes and rivers.  \nOn one hand, the alpine climate and landscapes are favourable for tourists as they consist of cold snowy winters and warm sunny summers. The snow during winter attracts winter sports such as skiing and ice-skating whereas warm and sunny summers attract tourists to view the beautiful sceneries, and engage in swimming and sunbathing.  \nThe Swiss people are hospitable, and the personnel handling tourists are well trained. The Swiss speak a variety of languages, namely, German, French and Italian. With these languages, the Swiss can easily communicate with tourists from various countries. Switzerland has a well-connected transport network which ensures easy and cheap movement of tourists within and outside the country. A variety of means of transport such as buses, electric trains, cable cars or aerial lifts and airways help to access various tourist attractions in the country. The country has a great number of high-class hotels to suit the needs of the tourists. Also, there are cottages, camping sites, taverns and guest houses.  \nSwitzerland has been and continues to tolerate different political ideologies. Thus, tourists from various countries of the world find it comfortable to visit Switzerland. Many towns in Switzerland such as Geneva, Bern and Zurich are headquarters of most international meetings by different organisations and associations such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), International Labour Organisation (ILO) and Federal International Football Association (FIFA). Therefore, people attending these meetings also take time off to visit tourist attractions, hence contributing to the country\u2019s tourism industry.",

For example, Table 6.1 shows revenue collected by national parks in Tanzania Mainland in the years 2017 and 2018.  \nTable 6.1 Revenue collected by national parks in Tanzania Mainland in USD  \n| Year | Revenues (US$ in millions) |\n| ---- | -------------------------- |\n| 2017 | 2,019.00                   |\n| 2018 | 2,043.00                   |  \nSource: Standard Digital April 2019  \n(b) The money obtained from tourism helps to improve and develop other sectors such as health, education, water supply, agriculture and transport.  \n(c) Tourism also creates employment opportunities among Tanzanians. Both skilled and unskilled workers can secure jobs in national parks and game reserves, hotels and lodges, transport and tour companies.  \n(d) Tourism contributes to the development of local handicraft industries. Tourists buy large quantities of handicrafts, especially wood carvings such as Makonde carvings, and wooden materials which attract more people to engage in such artistic productions.  \n(e) Tourism promotes international relations through co-operation and cultural tolerance among people, to foster cultural diversity.  \n(f) Tourism facilitates the development of infrastructure and services such as roads, airports, communication networks, water supply, electricity, hotels and proper sanitation. As a result, better services and standards of life are ensured for both tourists and natives.  \n(g) Tourism promotes the spirit of environmental conservation and preservation of historical sites. This, in turn, leads to sustainable use of tourist attractions for national development.  \n(h) Tourism is the source of foreign currency. Tourists pay for services they are provided with in foreign currency.  \n(i) Tourism facilitates the creation of different recreational centers to attract even more tourists. Such attractions include night clubs, swimming pools, and beaches.",

        "page_content": "#### Challenges facing tourism in Tanzania:  \nThe tourism industry in Tanzania is faced with problems of transport and communication, which are not that well-developed, hence limiting tourist movement. For example, some of the roads are rough and, therefore, it is impossible to use them during the rainy season. Internet services are also expensive and not reliable. The country also faces a problem of poor co-ordination between the government and other players in the industry. In addition, there is a shortage of funds for the development of the tourism industry. Moreover, Tanzania does not have adequate and sustainable marketing strategies to advertise and promote the unique attraction sites available in the country.  \nIncrease in population for settlement and agriculture expansion has led to encroachment on national parks and game reserves. This has led to degradation of wildlife areas, threatening their existence. In addition, crime and violent activities in some areas will discourage tourists from visiting such areas.  \n##### Promoting tourism in Tanzania:  \nThe following are the ways that can be used to promote tourism in Tanzania:  \n- Marketing strategies and publicity: Marketing of the tourism sector both domestically and internationally should be enhanced. There is a need for the government and other players in the industry to market aggressively the country\u2019s tourist attractions in international media and forums.\n- Provision of training: Tourism is a service industry that demands quality services for its sustainability. It is, therefore, important to have trained personnel who can offer quality services to meet international standards. This, in turn, will lead to increased influx of tourists.\n- Development of tourist attractions: The government should invest in expanding the tourist attractions in the country. This can be done by opening up new areas and diversifying tourist activities but also by promoting them as viable alternatives.\n- Improvement of infrastructure: There is a need to improve the existing accommodation, transport and communication infrastructure. This will improve the provision of services needed by tourists in the hospitality industry.\n- Involving the local communities: Involvement of local communities will promote a sustainable tourism industry. Indeed, protection of national parks and game reserves needs the commitment of the people living near the parks and game reserves. Moreover, communities should enjoy the benefits obtained from the use of protected areas by tourists.\n- Promotion of domestic tourism: Domestic tourism is not well-developed in Tanzania because of the high costs and lack of touring interest among natives. Therefore, domestic tourism should be promoted by offering affordable rates to natives. Also, eco-tourism should be established.\n- Lessons drawn to promote the tourism industry in Tanzania: The following are some of the lessons that can be drawn from focal studies discussed in relation to promoting the tourism industry in Tanzania.\n- Marketing: The Government of Tanzania as well as private players in the tourism industry should invest in marketing the country\u2019s tourism attractions all over the world. By doing so, the number of tourists will increase, thus contributing to the national economy.\n- Strong tourism policy: The government should formulate and enforce a strong tourism policy that is geared towards promoting culture-based tourism and eco-tourism.\n- Package tours: The government should promote package tours that allow for tour arrangements, including hotel reservations and travels to be done by a company. This will increase the number of tourists visiting the country.\n- Regional co-operation: Tanzania, as a member of Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), has to fully utilise opportunities aimed to promote the tourism industry especially through the use of the Regional Tourism Organisation of the Southern Africa Countries (RETOSA).",

These employees can raise their standards of living and improve quality of life with the income they earn. The income they earn caters for basic needs such as food, shelter, clothes and education.\n- (b) Manufacturing industries also lead to the diversification of the country\u2019s economy due to their potentials for promoting other sectors of the economy. This reduces over-dependence on one or two economic sectors, which can be affected by fluctuation of prices in the world market.\n- (c) Manufacturing industries enable countries to process locally produced raw materials before they are exported. This process helps to add value to the exports.\n- (d) Manufacturing industries stimulate the development of infrastructure such as railways and roads. These means of transport are useful in carrying raw materials to manufacturing centers and the finished or unfinished goods to the markets.\n- (e) Industries also help to create a large internal market as workers get wages and salaries from industries which enable them to buy goods and services. In fact, the more the workers, the larger the market for manufacturing industries.\n- (f) Manufacturing industries also lead to increased agricultural production. For example, the textile industry requires cotton as raw material. Thus, it can stimulate the expansion of cotton growing.\n- (g) Manufacturing industries are sources of foreign currency. The products manufactured in a country are exported to other countries for sale which, in turn, attract foreign currency.\n- (h) Manufacturing industries reduce the country\u2019s dependence on imported goods because a country with well-developed manufacturing industries can meet the needs of the people.\n- (i) Manufacturing industries also stimulate the development of science and technology. Indeed, for a country to develop well in manufacturing industries, it needs to invest in science and technology to increase production.\n- (j) Manufacturing industries improve international relations through trade transactions with different countries. These trade transactions improve relations between the importing and exporting countries.",

They produce goods which can be used as raw materials for other industries or can be directly consumed. These industries are also concerned with the processing of bulk raw materials into other products. Some of these are described below.  \n(a) Textile processing industries:These industries deal with spinning and weaving of textile materials from cotton, wool and silk. Artificial fibres such as rayon, nylon and dacron are used in textile industries. Textile industries in Tanzania include Musoma Textile (MUTEX), Mwanza Textile (MWATEX), Karibu Textile Mills (KTM) and Morogoro Polytex.  \nLeather processing industry includes hides, and skins. Despite its potential to contribute to the economy in terms of employment creation, income generation, foreign earnings and poverty reduction, its current contribution to development is still low. The comprehensive leather sector development strategy of Tanzania endeavours to generate the conditions for a favourable expansion of the industry so as to contribute to overall socio-economic development. Such development will require the coordination of various activities such as the ability of stakeholders to plan and coordinate actions in results. The plants include Moshi industries, Tanzania leather industry, Afro leather, Kibaha Tannery, Himo Tanners and Salex Tanners.  \n(b) Chemical industries: These are industries which produce highly specialised products such as acids, gases, medicine, paints, pestecides, alkalis, soaps and fertilisers. Good examples are the Mansoor Daya Chemicals, Zenufa Laboratories and Unilever Tanzania which deal with detergents, soaps and other products. Their raw materials include acids, dyes and fertilisers. Zoom Tanzania manufactures chemicals for households and for industrial purposes, such as Pine disinfectact, A1 liquid soap, clorite bleach, and kioo glass cleaner.  \n(c) Food and beverage processing industries: These industries deal with the preparation of food stuffs and drinks such as meat packaging, fruit canning, flour milling, bottling and brewing, sugar refining, meat processing and packaging, Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola, Azam Cola and brewing industries. Examples include Cool Blue Tanzania (producing mineral water), Chai Bora (Tea leaves), Said Salim Bakhresa & Co. Ltd (Mzizima Flour Mill).  \n(d) Metallurgical industries:\nMetallurgical industries deal with the production of iron and steel as raw materials in engineering industries, for example, Aluminium Africa Limited (ALAF), the Motisun Group in Dar es Salaam and AIM Steel Ltd in Arusha that deal with steel and pre-coated sheets.  \n(e) Craft industries: These are industries which deal with spinning, weaving, dyeing of cotton cloth, tanning and leather making, wool carving, basket making, pottery and gold, and silver smelting.

        "page_content": "#### Factors for the location of manufacturing industries:  \nThe establishment of an industry in a certain area depends on many factors, some of which are described below.  \n##### Availability of raw materials:  \nCloseness to the sources of raw materials reduces transport costs and time for the materials to reach the industry. In most industries, transportation of raw materials from the source to the industries is part of the production cost. Industries which use heavy and bulky raw materials are usually located near the source of raw materials. For example, Twiga Cement Industry in Dar es Salaam is located near limestone deposits (Figure 7.1). Other cement industries are Dangote (Mtwara), Tanga Cement and Mbeya Cement in Tanga and Mbeya respectively.  \nFigure 7.1 Lorries carrying cement at Twiga Cement factory, Tanzania  \n##### Power supply:  \nIndustries need reliable and adequate power supply to run machines. The availability of this power supply ensures constant production of goods in the industries. The common sources of power used in manufacturing industries are hydro-electrical power, coal, natural gas, solar and nuclear power. Industries located close to sources of power are more profitable than those located far away.  \n##### Transport and communication networks:  \nTransport is an essential component in movement of raw materials to the industrial areas and the manufactured goods to the markets. A good transport network helps to reduce costs and facilitates the movement of raw materials and manufactured products. The commonly used means of transport are roads, railways, waterways and airways.  \n##### Market:  \nThe availability of a reliable market for the manufactured goods is one of the essential factors that account for the development of manufacturing industries. Availability of the markets can determine production efficiency. Industrial production depends on the demand for goods, which also determines the location of such industries.  \n###### Labour:  \nThe labour force required by an industry depends on the type of the manufacturing industry. Both skilled and unskilled labour is required for the development of manufacturing industries. Thus, the development of manufacturing industries tend to flourish in areas where labour is available and stable.  \n##### Capital:  \nAvailability of capital is a very important factor for the development of manufacturing industries. This is money invested in starting a business. Money is required to buy the site, build offices, purchase raw materials, pay workers and market products.  \n##### Government policy:  \nGovernment policies may encourage or discourage the location of industries in certain areas due to social (population or market), economic (introduction of protective tariffs), political (civil wars, political influence) or environmental (climate) reasons. Supportive policies attract both internal and external investors. Supportive policies provide possibilities for financial support through loans and friendly conditions to investors.  \n##### Water:  \nAvailability of regular and abundant supply of water is essential for the development of industries since most industries require large quantities of water for their operations. For example, iron and steel industries require water for cooling purposes, textile industries for washing fibres, chemical, pulping and timber industries for proper functioning. Water may be required either in the processing of raw materials or for cooling machines.",

Skilled labour is required in the textile industry for designing, spinning, cotton weaving, bleaching, dyeing, and printing of cotton fabrics. Unskilled labour is equally needed to support skilled workers, for example, by clearing and providing security.  \nThe textile industry also stimulates production in other sectors of the economy such as agriculture, transportation, commerce, and trade. The industry operates because raw materials are readily available. In Tanzania, cotton is the main raw material for the textile industry. Farmers will continue to produce cotton when they are assured of ready markets for their cotton.  \nAnother important contribution is the development of transport infrastructure such as roads and railways. Good transport enables cotton to reach the factory and products to reach the market at a minimum cost and in time. Textile industries are also sources of foreign currency. The development of the textile industry depends on the availability of both internal and international markets. Since there is no country that can meet the demands of its people by only using locally produced goods, there is a need to produce more for export to get foreign currency. Textile industries also promote international relations through trade. There is so much trading in the world because of differences in resource endowment and climate. For example, there are countries producing cars (Japan) while others produce textile materials (Tanzania). This distribution of manufactures justifies the need for trading of the products among nations, which also helps build healthy and good relations.",

They produce electronic equipment and cars of good quality which are sold all over the world. The following are some of the lessons Tanzania can learn from Japan and South Korea:  \n- Management of industries: Various industries in Japan and South Korea are properly managed. For example, industries employ skilled workers with the required qualifications. Workers use time and other industry\u2019s resources effectively. As a result, they produce efficiently for profit. The industrial managers work on a set of objectives and are not involved in any type of corruption. The same practices should be adopted in Tanzania\u2019s industries.\n- Improved transport and communication network: Well-developed transport and communication in Japan and Korea play a big role in the development of industries as the transportation of raw materials tends to be easy and at low costs. Similar conditions should be created to increase productivity in Tanzania\u2019s industries.\n- Investment in research: Both Japan and Korea have heavily invested in research and development particularly on better, efficient, and effective production methods. This has continually improved their production methods and made the costs manageable. Therefore, Tanzania needs to invest in research.\n- Training and development of workers: Japan and Korea have been allocating adequate funds for training to enhance workers\u2019 productivity. This is something that Tanzania should also do to improve the industrial sector.\n- Spirit of commitment and hard work: The workers in Japan and South Korea are committed to accomplishing the duties and responsibilities assigned to them. This practice has led to increased efficiency in their industrial production. Therefore, workers in Tanzania\u2019s industries should develop the same spirit.\n- Production of high-quality products: Industrial products from Japan and South Korea are of high quality and can compete with similar products from other competitors. Therefore, Tanzania has the duty to ensure that its industrial products meet international standards.\n- Reliable source of power and energy: Japan and South Korea exploit different sources of energy, hence making power cheap and available all the time. They have hydro-electric power and nuclear power which make the availability of power very reliable. Tanzania should follow this example by exploiting various sources of energy rather than depending only on hydro-electric power.",

        "page_content": "### The concept of Power and Energy  \nPower: Power is the flow of energy at any one time, and can be generated from renewable energy resources through solar conversion (solar, thermal electricity, solar heating); harnessing water (hydropower for electricity, wave and tidal generation through turbines); harnessing the wind (wind pumps for water, wind turbines for electricity); and a variety of other energy sources. The main power sources are petroleum (oil), natural gas, water, coal and nuclear. Other sources include the earth\u2019s interior (hot springs), wind, sun, tides, and waves, wood, peat and cattle or cow dung (biogas).  \nPower is found within our bodies, machines, in plants and bodies of animals, insects and birds. Power is also inherently present in natural forces like wind, tides, waves, and water whose movements can be utilized to drive machines, or generate electricity. In our daily lives, power is needed to cook food, to drive machinery in industrial plants, to provide light and heat, and to propel vehicles of different types.  \nEnergy: Energy can be defined as the capacity for, or equivalent of, doing work. Energy is the ability to work so as to produce motion. For example, when water turns a turbine, electricity is produced. Also energy is used to drive machines and provide heat and light.  \nThe society requires energy for transportation, heating and cooling of buildings, powering production processes in industry, and various household needs. Energy can be grouped into various types as explained below.  \nPrimary and secondary energy: Primary energy sources are those that are either found or stored in nature. This type of energy is captured directly from natural resources. Common primary energy sources are coal, oil, natural gas, and biomass (such as wood). Other primary energy sources include available nuclear energy from radioactive substances, thermal energy stored in the earth\u2019s interior, and potential energy due to earth\u2019s gravity. The primary energy sources are converted into secondary energy sources; for example coal, oil or gas are converted into steam and electricity. Also, heat is a primary energy, which can be transformed into secondary geothermal or solar electricity.  \nCommercial and non-commercial energy: Energy sources are regarded as commercial if they are available in the market for a definite price. The most common examples of these energy sources are electricity, coal, and refined petroleum products. These sources are the basis for industrial, agricultural, transport and commercial development in the contemporary world. Likewise, they are predominant sources of household energy especially in developed countries. Non-commercial energy sources are not available in the commercial market for a price. They include fuels such as firewood, cattle dung, and agricultural waste used by households. These are fuelwood, water, coal, natural gas, oil, hot traditionally gathered and not bought at any price especially in rural areas.  \nRenewable and non-renewable energy: Renewable energy is energy generated from sources that are essentially inexhaustible. Examples of renewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, geothermal energy, tidal power, and hydroelectric power. Non-renewable energy includes conventional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which are likely to get depleted with use.  \nConventional and non-conventional energy: Conventional energy is an energy source which is fixed in nature like oil, gas, coal, and hydropower generation. It is also termed as non-renewable energy or thermal energy. The conventional energy resources are being used extensively; as a result, their known reserves have been depleted to a great extent. The use of conventional energy has emerging effects on the environment. The non-conventional energy involves energy generated by wind, tides, solar and biomass. These are renewable sources of energy and not exhaustible.",

        "page_content": "### Major sources of power and energy:  \nThe primary source of energy is the Sun. Other sources of power and energy are fuelwood, water, coal, natural gas, oil, hot springs, wind, biomass and tidal waves. The sources of energy are categorized as renewable and non-renewable.  \nRenewable energy sources: Renewable energy is any energy source that is naturally replaced. The energy can be derived from sunlight, tides, wind, water, geothermal, or hydroelectric action. Likewise, energy produced from the refining of various forms of biomass is often classified as renewable. The renewable energy sources are usually regarded as environmentally friendly because they release few chemicals that can harm the environment. These are energy resources that are naturally reused. Renewable sources are sustainable if they are carefully managed and maintained. They have minimal negative effects on the environment. Renewable energy sources include sunlight, geothermal heat, wind, tides, water, and various forms of biomass. Some of these energy sources are described in the following sub-sections.  \nBiogas energy: Biogas is a mixture of gases produced by decomposition of organic matter such as waste from manure, plant materials, sewage, green waste, or food waste. The main components of biogas are methane and carbon dioxide. Biogas may be used to reduce high cost associated with other sources of energy and reduce over-dependence on fuelwood as the only source of energy. Biogas is less costly than other sources of energy and does not require specialized knowledge to operate.  \nWind energy: Wind energy refers to the energy that is generated from wind. Wind mills have been used for hundreds of years to pump water from the ground. Currently, wind turbines are used to generate electricity. Wind is the second most frequently applied energy source in the world with a total installed capacity of 539.123 Gigawatt (GW) in 2017. Before harnessing wind energy, research on variables such as speed, direction, and persistency is necessary. Thereafter, wind turbines have to be set. A wind turbine operates on the following simple principles:  \n1. The power from the wind turns the windmill that has two or three propeller-like blades around a rotor.\n2. The motor is connected to a main shaft that spins a generator to generate energy. Figure 8.1 shows a windmill farm.  \nIn Tanzania the utilisation of wind energy is encouraged by factors such as the increase in the costs of oil along frequent hydro power cuts, and increased demand of power which is influenced by high population growth. Tanzania has areas of high wind potential that cover more than 10% of its land.  \nResearch works indicate that Tanzania has a lot of wind energy resources in the areas of Great Lakes, the plains, and the highland plateau regions of the Rift Valley. Also, areas such as Makambako (Njombe) and Kititimo (Singida) have sufficient wind speed for grid scale electricity generation.  \nThe advantage of using wind energy is that it does not pollute the environment. Also, it occupies a small ground space. The limitation of using wind energy is that wind turbines can disturb, or kill flying creatures like birds.  \nFigure 8.1 Windmill farm\nSource: https://www.desertsun.com/story/tech/science/energyparts  \nSolar energy: Solar energy is generated from the Sun using collector panels. The collected energy can be used to provide heat, light, or other forms of electricity. It is used in Tanzania though in small-scale. The distribution of solar energy depends on the overhead sun of a particular place. It is harnessed by using two methods: (i) through plates which are used to collect and reflect heat to power generators; (ii) by using Photovoltaic Cells (PV) composed of semi-conducting materials that convert sunrays into electric currents that it does not pollute the environment. This method is commonly used in many places for lighting homes and traffic roads as well as street lights.  \nThe PV cells are combined to form solar panels (Figure 8.2). The panels usually differ in size depending on the purpose of their installation. The series of combined PV cells are usually placed on roofs of houses or on top of traffic lights to form the panels, which capture solar energy. For adequate energy to be obtained, solar panels should face the sun so that more sunrays are converted into electrical energy.\nChina, Germany, Italy, the USA, and Japan possess the biggest solar photovoltanic (PV) technology capacity in the world.  \nIn Tanzania, solar energy is used as a source of power by 24.7% of the households that have access to electricity. High potentials of solar energy resources are found in the central parts of the country.\nCurrently, solar energy is used in different parts of Tanzania. Solar thermal is used for heating and drying; and photovoltaic is used for lighting, water pumps, refrigeration purposes and telecommunication. Solar energy is used mostly in rural areas by about 64% of its people compared to urban areas with only 3.4%. The regions of Lindi, Njombe, Mtwara, Katavi, and Ruvuma lead in the use of solar power electricity in Tanzania.  \nThe advantages of using solar energy is that it is friendly to the environment. However, the technology for utilising and harnessing solar energy is expensive.  \n| Figure 8.2 Solar panels   | Figure 8.3 Geothermal Plant      |\n| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| Source: shuttersstock.com | Source: Free photoon.pixabay.com |  \nGeothermal energy: Geothermal energy refers to the heat energy generated and stored in the earth. Tapping this energy involves pumping cold water into hot rock boreholes and extracting the steam through another borehole. Due to the force by which the hot water comes out, it has the ability to drive turbines to generate electricity. Geothermal power production is mostly found in volcanic areas. Geothermal evidence in Tanzania is found in Mara, Manyara, Mbeya, and Rukwa. In these areas, water naturally flows out as hot fountains. Geothermal evidence is also found in Kenya, South-Eastern Nigeria, Madagascar, USA, New Zealand, and Iceland. Figure 8.3 shows a geothermal plant generating electricity. Geothermal energy can be used for domestic purposes or on a large scale by industries. It was used during earliest times for bathing and space heating. The biggest disadvantage with geothermal energy is that it can only be produced at selected sites.  \nHydro-electric power energy: Hydro- electric power is created by the force of flowing water from mountains or high landform streams. Thus hydro-electric power is a result of water in motion. Moving water possesses energy which can be converted into electric energy if the following conditions are met:\n(i) There should be a constant supply of water. This is possible if the sources of water are areas where there is heavy rainfall, natural lake or melting water from mountain glaciers. It is also possible where there is a reservoir that could be a lake or dam to store the water needed.\n(ii) There must be a ready market for the power generated. The aim is to minimise the cost of transmitting electricity.\n(iii) The ground has to be steep to allow fast flow of water. For example, a waterfall that can drive hydro turbines.\nA dam can be constructed across a river or along the coastal strip where tidal waves are common. The power house is constructed adjacent to the dam. Then, water at very high speed (from streams, glaciers, natural water falls or man-made dams) is directed to the turbine chamber.  \nAs the turbine rotates, the generator or dynamo also rotates to produce electric power. The power generated is then transmitted to the transformer where it is transmitted for industrial and domestic uses, as shown in Figure 8.4.  \nHEP is primarily advantageous because it does not discharge pollutants into the environment. In addition, if people turn to using hydroelectric power, deforestation caused by use of fuelwood may be reduced. The problems faced with hydropower have to do with the aging of the dams. It is costly to maintain them for their functionality and safety. Globally, China has the biggest hydroelectric generation capacity in the world, followed by Brazil, Canada, and Russia. Currently, hydropower constitutes over 45% of the total power generated in Tanzania.  \n| Figure 8.4 | Hydro-electric power/energy             |\n| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| Figure 8.4 | A model of a hydro-electric power plant |  \nFuelwood: Wood energy is energy generated from wood extracted products through combustion processes. The energy is used for cooking, heating, and generation for electricity. Likewise, the term \u201cwood energy\u201d is used to refer to wood and materials developed from wood used for energy purposes (\u201cwoodfuel\u201d). Woodfuel can be in solid, liquid or gaseous form. Examples of solid woodfuel include firewood, charcoal, and wood pellets produced from wood or wood residues. Liquid woodfuel include Bio\u2013oil, Bioethanol and gaseous woodfuel including wood gas.  \nFuelwood comprises unprocessed wood biomass harvested from stems, branches or other parts of trees. Likewise, sometimes it is generated from wood residues such as sawdust and wood shavings generated from timber harvesting, or wood processing industries. Globally, roughly 2500 million people rely on wood fuel for heating and cooking. In USA, the community uses about 85% of all the wood collected from forests as fuel or charcoal for heating and cooking.  \nIn Tanzania, biomass/bio-power (wood) is the largest energy source. More than 1 million people engage in charcoal production and supply. Currently, there is an upsurge in modern biomass utilization. The raw materials available such as municipal solid waste, forest residues, sugar bagasse, rice husk, sisal, and coffee can be used to generate power.",

        "page_content": "#### Non-renewable energy sources:  \nThese refer to sources of energy that cannot be re-used. They are non-renewable because their formation takes a long time, usually millions of years. Fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas are non-renewable sources of energy. They originate from remains of plants and animals which have decomposed for a long time under high pressure and heat. These energy sources are described in the following sub-sections.  \nNuclear energy: Nuclear energy is derived from atoms by altering or breaking their structure. Alteration of the structure of the atom leads to a release of energy in the form of heat. Released energy is used to generate electricity. An important raw material for this process is uranium. Although nuclear energy itself is a renewable energy source, the material used in nuclear plants is not renewable. Nuclear power is mostly generated in USA, France, Russia, China, India, Canada, Israel and UK. Nuclear power plants do not produce or emit greenhouse gases. They can be built in both rural and urban areas, and do not destroy the surrounding environment. However, nuclear energy is difficult to harvest and nuclear plants are very complicated to build and run. Likewise, in many communities there is limited capacity to develop a safe and reliable nuclear energy programme. Nuclear energy also produces radioactive materials, which increase health risks in the communities where the plants are located.  \nCoal energy: Coal occurs in sedimentary rocks in layers or seams of varying thickness. It is available in different countries such as Tanzania, China, USA and South Africa. If the coal seams are near the earth\u2019s surface, coal is extracted through strip mining. Under this method, coal is exposed via an open-pit into coal deposits. If coal is found in a mountain peak, extraction involves the removal of the highest part of that mountain to recover the coal. Burned coal produces heat energy, which is used for purposes such as domestic heating, smelting of iron and steel, boiling of water and steam production.  \nPetroleum: Petroleum is organic in origin. It occurs in the pore spaces between sedimentary rocks. Once a drilling site is decided upon, a steel derrick about 30 metres or more depending on the location of the petroleum bearing rock is fixed upright and the equipment for drilling is used. Steel tubes are inserted into the boreholes. Once the drill reaches the oil bearing rock layer, oil flows out through the boreholes and keeps flowing as shown in Figure 8.5. The oil is then transported through pipelines to the refinery.  \nNatural gas energy: Natural gas is often found together with petroleum. It is found concentrated in the uppermost part of the trap. Sometimes, natural gas occurrence is independent of petroleum. Natural gas is mainly composed of hydrogen, carbons and methane. Other ingredients of natural gas include butane, propane, ethane, helium, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide. Natural gas is extracted by drilling a borehole in the ground before inserting steel tubes into the borehole. Once the drill has reached the gas-bearing rock layer, gas flows out through the borehole and keeps flowing through special pipes up to the power generating plant where the refining takes place. Figure 8.6 is an example of a natural gas plant.  \nFigure 8.6 Natural gas plant at Kinyerezi 1, Dar es Salaam\nSource: http://csi.energy/project/kinyerezi-1-power-plant-Tourist attraction:Places with energy 150-mw/",

In the agricultural sector, energy is used to run farm machinery and equipment such as tractors and combine harvesters.  \nRaw materials: Some sources of energy are raw materials of some industries. For example, oil is a raw material for petrochemical and refinery industries in the making of plastics, medicines, clothes, and ropes.  \nTransport enhancement: Energy plays an important role in improving the transport sector because vehicles, locomotives, aircraft, and vessels use petrol or diesel.  \nEconomic development: Energy is a source of foreign currency. Some countries export electricity to other countries. Other sources such as oil, coal, and natural gas are exported to other countries and earn foreign currency, which is used to develop other sectors such as agriculture, education, and health. Also, the generated electricity can be sold to other countries and earn foreign currency.  \nTourist attraction: Places with energy installations tend to attract tourists, for example, geothermal, HEP stations, and windmill plants.  \nFishing and irrigation areas: The dams constructed to produce HEP become useful in fishing and irrigation. For example, Mtera Dam has become a source of fish for commercial and domestic use.  \nEmployment: Power and energy generation employs so many people who work in the power plants.",

Some of these are described below.  \n- Drought: Prolonged droughts decrease the volume of water, which in turn reduces the ability of hydro-electric power plants to produce electricity.\n- Inadequate capital: The construction of dams and hydro-electric power stations requires heavy capital outlays. Capital is also essential in the production and transportation of natural gas. Unfortunately, many developing countries lack capital to harness fossil fuel and hydropower potentials.\n- Transport and communication networks: These are inadequate in many developing countries, which hinders the extraction or transmission of energy and power.\n- Poor technology and lack of skilled personnel: Some energy and power production systems such as nuclear, tidal, and geothermal energy require advanced technology, which is lacking in most developing countries.\n- Environmental pollution: Energy and power production may lead to environmental pollution. This happens when fossil fuel produces pollutants, including greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen oxide due to burning. This contributes to water and air pollution, global warming, and climate change.\n- Dam siltation: Siltation of dams constructed for HEP reduces the capacity of reservoirs. This affects the generation of hydro-electric power, and sometimes causes flooding.\n- Disposal of nuclear waste: Nuclear waste is highly radioactive. It needs to be safely disposed of or stored for many years. But the process is extremely expensive.\n- Environmental disaster: Nuclear power generation if not well-handled can be disastrous due to leakage at nuclear plants. For example, Fukushima in Japan in 2011 and Chernobyl in Russia in 1986 had nuclear leakage, which led to environmental disaster including air and land pollution, and loss of biodiversity.\n- Forest degradation and loss: Establishment of hydro-electric power stations leads to clearance of vegetation or submerges large tracts of land which destroys wildlife habitats and, sometimes, reduces land for agriculture.\n- Price fluctuation: Fluctuations of prices of fossil fuel affect production. Sometimes, oil-producing countries have to reduce oil production to control the price in the world market. This calculated reduction affects economies of supplying and buying countries.",

If desilting is ignored, the decreased depth of dams may affect the production of HEP since the storage capacity of the dam is severely reduced.\n- Alternative energy sources: Alternative sources of energy such as solar energy should be used to reduce the effect of pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels and fuelwood.\n- Environmental conservation projects: The establishment of power and energy production projects should go hand in hand with environmental conservation projects such as afforestation, reforestation, and proper waste management.\n- Community awareness creation: Environmental conservation education should be provided to the people. Such education will encourage community members to report and take permanent or temporary measures in the utilization of power and energy to avoid endangering the environment.\n- Research on power and energy: There is a need for governments to invest comprehensively in research on power and energy resources to identify different sources of power and efficient use of the existing energy resources.\n- Technology: Environmentally friendly technologies for power and energy production should be developed.",

HEP is one of the main sources of power in Tanzania. In Tanzania, electricity generation depends heavily on HEP. However, this type of energy cannot be relied upon in times of drought. The government through the Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO), a parastatal organization, manages the HEP across the country. The company produces hydro-electricity from natural waterfalls or man-made dams and supplies it to the users in the country.  \nThe main hydro-electric power stations are Mtera and Kidatu on Ruaha River, Kihansi on Kihansi River, Nyumba ya Mungu and Hale on Pangani River. Biogas is a renewable source of energy generated from the decay of plants and animal waste. The gases include methane and ethane. Biogas requires high initial capital in construction of a biogas plant. The major components include trench silo for storage of solid raw material; digester (decomposer) reservoir for completing biogas production; liquid manure tank for keeping fresh liquid manure; solid manure tank for keeping and adding solid manure; pipes for distribution of biogas; and power station for provision of power (Figure 8.7). Notably, production of biogas is possible in cattle rearing regions because the major raw material for the production is cow dung. Mwanza, Tabora, Shinyanga, Mara, Rukwa, Iringa, Mbeya, Tanga, Kagera, Morogoro and Singida are cattle rearing regions and, hence, have high potential for producing biogas. Yet, biogas in Tanzania is not well developed.  \nIn most cases, individuals and groups carry out biogas projects at a local level, for example, the Hamasa biogas project in Marimba and Majabimu in Muheza. There are also few national programmes dealing with biogas, for example, the Tanzania Domestic Biogas Programme. It is estimated that Tanzania has 4,633 verified biogas plants and 9,990 unverified plants. Overall, the country has a potential to build 20,000 institutional plants.  \nFigure 8.7: Biogas power plant\nSource: Acrosystech.com",

        "page_content": "### Importance of HEP and biogas energy resources in Tanzania  \nTanzania\u2019s major electrical energy is obtained primarily from HEP followed by natural gas. These energy sources are important to the economy of the country. HEP and biogas energy are important in many ways.  \nUse at the local level: Production of biogas requires simple technology, which can be handled by any interested person. Based on technological simplicity, biogas is prominent at local levels in Tanzania.  \nWaste management: Use of biogas enhances management of wastes mainly animal dung. All animal dung around people\u2019s homes is collected and ferried to the processing area to produce power. People with many livestock find biogas production as an effective way of keeping their areas clean.  \nReduced over-dependence on fuelwood: The use of biogas reduces over-dependence on fuelwood as a source of energy. In areas where biogas is used, people have reduced the use of fuelwood for heating and cooking. This may in turn reduce deforestation and emission of greenhouse gases.  \nMajor source of electricity: HEP is a major source of electricity, which is widely used in Tanzania. As the government centrally manages HEP by 98 percent, all the regions access it through TANESCO, a public utility company, and puts it into various uses, lighting being the main use.  \nImprovement of standards of living: The availability of biogas and hydro-electric power in rural areas has improved people\u2019s standards of living. With power, people have managed to start small projects such as welding, carpentry, and milling. Such projects have become sources of income for the people and have improved their standards of living.  \nReduction of health risks: It is medically proven that soot breathed from household air pollution causes respiratory diseases among children. Thus, by using HEP and biogas, such kind of respiratory diseases are reduced or eradicated.  \nEstablishment and growth of industries: The availability of energy, especially HEP promotes the establishment and growth of industries that, in turn, creates employment opportunities.  \nEmployment opportunities: HEP and biogas energy resources create employment opportunities especially during production, transmission and distribution of electricity from HEP stations.",

        "page_content": "### Challenges to harnessing power and energy in Tanzania:  \nPower and energy harnessing in Tanzania faces various challenges ranging from naturally occurring to human-made ones. The following are some of the challenges facing power and energy harnessing in Tanzania.  \nFluctuation of river volume: In the dry season, rain may be scarce or completely absent which reduces water in dams and, consequently, lowers the generation of HEP. Tanzania has been experiencing periods of power-cut particularly during the dry season because of over-dependence on HEP.  \nInadequate capital for exploration: Exploration of sources of power and their harnessing is supposed to be a continuous activity. However, exploration demands large injection of capital, which is not readily available particularly in developing countries. Inadequate funds for the exploration of power sources and their harnessing has been a recurrent problem in Tanzania. There is generally little or no establishment of new sources of energy. As a result, there has been over-dependence on the same sources of power and energy, mainly HEP and natural gas.  \nHuman activities: Human activities such as construction and cultivation expose soil to running water. This water carries silt which is deposited in the dam causing siltation. Siltation usually reduces the capacity of dams to store water, which in turn affects production of HEP.  \nConflicts and sabotage: Construction of dams, roads and pipelines can lead to the displacement of people. When people are displaced without being compensated for their houses and farms, conflicts and sabotage may arise. An example of such scenario is the 2013 protest by Mtwara residents over the construction of natural gas pipeline.  \nHigh initial investment costs: High costs of transmission of power from its source has affected the government\u2019s efforts in transmitting power to different parts of the country. A large percentage of Tanzania is not electrified. By year 2012 statistics indicated that only 14 percent of the country was electrified, of which 12 percent was urban and two percent was rural. Access to electricity was only 18.4 percent in the same period.  \nWater-borne diseases: Construction of reservoirs and dams may lead to the occurrence of water-borne and waterrelated diseases such as cholera, typhoid and bilharzia. For example, statistics indicate that about 15 million people in sub-Saharan Africa live within five kilometres of large dams and more than 1.1 million cases of malaria annually are associated with these dams.",

By 2013, the annual power demand increase was between 10 percent and 15 percent. The demand for power and energy is expected to increase because of the new industries that are to be constructed.  \nFunds allocation for exploration: The government is required to allocate adequate funds for exploring other sources of power. Tanzania is endowed with many power and energy sources, which have not been yet harnessed due to lack of capital.  \nTraining of skilled personnel: More young Tanzanians should be trained on HEP and biogas exploration and production.  \nImprovement of infrastructure: In making energy more accessible to all, infrastructure should be improved. Inland roads in remote areas should be rehabilitated to easen transportation of poles for the supply of electricity. Pipeline networks for natural gas distribution should also be built in various parts of the country for electricity generation.  \nCommunity awareness creation: The society should be educated on the need to conserve the environment by using environmentally-friendly sources of power.  \nEnvironmental conservation campaign: Various campaigns towards environmental conservation have been launched in Tanzania. Examples include the Mama Misitu campaign which was launched in Tanzania. This five-year (2011 - 2016) campaign aimed to improve community based forest governance. When forests are protected there would be less erosion and, hence, less siltation.",

Before 2008, much of the electricity was generated from other sources such as fossil fuel and HEP. By 2018, solar power accounted for 1.44 percent of the total USA electricity, generating about 58.9 terawatt-hours (TWH).  \nUSA needs energy that is secure, reliable, protective of the environment, and able to address climate change, create jobs and improve public health. USA reduced the use of fossil fuel as a source of energy because it is expensive and not renewable. The American Government reduces the cost of solar power and increases the cost of fossil fuel to encourage use of the former. USA, as a highly developed country in terms of technology and economy, has a very high demand for power and energy for industrial and domestic use.  \nSolar energy is harnessed on a large- scale in the states of California, Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina, New Jersey and Massachusetts. These areas are more conducive for harnessing solar power because of the sunny climate, clear skies and plenty of land. The electricity generated is integrated into the US National Grid.  \nWind energy is also used more in USA compared to solar energy. The country has a big potential of onshore and offshore winds. Wind energy is used in running large farms and industries. The leading wind energy producing centers are California, Oklahoma, Illinois, and Kansas. Wind power generation and use in USA is expanding quickly. It experiences an annual growth of 25.6 percent. For example, in 2017, wind power generated 6.3 percent of electricity in the USA.",

These energies, therefore, are considered to be environmentally-friendly. For example, their production reduces the emission of carbon-dioxide and other pollutants.  \nCreation of employment opportunities: Installation and management of solar panels and wind mills require many employees. This industry generates jobs for thousands of people.  \nIndustrial development: In USA, solar and wind energy have been found to be feasible sources of alternative energy for industrial development. The energy generated is considered cheaper than other available sources of energy such as fossil energy, HEP, natural gas, and nuclear energy.  \nExpansion of agriculture: Large-scale agriculture has been made possible by the availability of electricity from this source. The power is used in irrigation and processing of agricultural products.  \nAffordability: Solar and wind energy are relatively cheaper for many people in USA especially those who are unable to use other sources of electricity because it is subsidized by the government.

        "page_content": "#### Challenges facing solar and wind energy in USA:  \nAlthough USA has a large and strong economy, it faces challenges related to the wind and solar energy sector. The following are some of the challenges.  \nSolar panel efficiency: Most solar power panels are 10 \u2013 20 percent efficient, as they are stationary and cannot move to capture the sun\u2019s rays. That being the case, a large percentage of the energy from the sun remains largely untapped, although the cost of solar power has decreased.  \nReliability: Solar and wind energy are not reliable sources of energy because sunrays and wind happen naturally and human beings can hardly control their occurrence. The extent of solar and wind energy production will largely depend on the intensity of wind and sunrays and the technology available to tap them.  \nCost of installation: The initial installation cost of solar infrastructures sis high. US government subsidises solar installation. This enables many people interested in this energy to afford the cost.  \nTransmission costs: Although a certain amount of wind may be available everywhere, not all wind speeds are favourable to produce wind energy. There are specific sites with the potential for wind energy production. These sites are often located in remote locations far from cities, hence making transmission of energy for use expensive.  \nLand use: Harnessing wind power tends to compete with alternative uses of land. For example, a place with strong winds, which may be considered to have the potential for harnessing wind energy may also be important for industrial development. Both are important uses of the land, hence deciding on the best use of the site might not be easy.  \nNoise and aesthetic pollution: Wind power plants may produce unwanted noise from turbine blades. They may also disturb the visual aspect of the landscape. However, compared to other conventional power plants, they have relatively less negative impact on the environment.",

        "page_content": "### Main types of transport  \nTransport is categorised into land, air and water systems as illustrated in Figure 9.1:  \nLand transport: Land transport involves the movement of people, goods and services from one location to another, on land. It is the most commonly used mode of transportation in the world. Land transport may further be divided into road transport, rail transport, cable transport and pipeline transport. The description of each mode of transport is provided in the sections that follow.  \nRoad transport: Road transport is a means of transport that connects one place to another on the surface of the earth. It is the most common means of transport used all over the world. Transport on roads can be grouped into the transport of goods and people. Movement along roads may be done by bike or automobile, truck, or by animals such as horses, donkeys or oxen. Cargo may be transported by trucking companies, while passengers may be transported via mass transit. Road transport is the most frequently used mode of transport in the world. It involves the use of various types of animals, vehicles, motorcycles and bicycles. Roads play a great role in socio-economic development. In most cases, the delivery of goods between cities, towns and villages is facilitated by road transport. The advantage of road transport over other modes of transport is that it even operates where other means of transport are not available.  \nAnimal transport involves carts drawn by donkeys, camels, horses and oxen. This type of transport is common especially in places where other means of transport are not available. Animal transport is mostly used in mountainous regions and deserts to carry crops, straw, fodder and people. Luggage is packed into carts pulled by horses, donkeys and bullocks. For camels, goods are fastened totheanimal.Transportofgoodsbyroad depends on the degree of development of the local infrastructure, distance, type of goods, weight and volume of the shipment. Figure 9.2 shows trucks that exemplify motor-driven transport, Figure 9.3 shows a donkey with luggage strapped onto its back and Figure 9.4 shows a man riding a cart pulled by a donkey.  \nFigure 9.2 Transportation by trucks\nSource: ajot.com  \nFigure 9.3 Transportation by animals\nSource: spana.org  \nFigure 9.4 Transportation by a donkey driven cart  \nRail transport: Railway transport is the second most important mode of transport after road transport. Rail transport involves the movement of goods and passengers on rail lines by trains. It is an important land transport mode and the most appropriate means of transportation for bulky goods over long distances. Railway transport carries many people and goods at once compared to other means of land transport. Trains are of two main categories. passenger trains and cargo train.  \nPassenger trains carry both people and a limited quantity of goods, cargo trains are exclusively used for carrying goods or cargo from one place to another. Figure 9.5 shows a passenger train.  \nFigure 9.5 TAZARA passenger train\nSource: www.zambianpolitics.com  \nIn East Africa, there are several railway lines. These include the Tanzania- Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA) covering 1,067 km, connecting Dar es Salaam to Kapiri Mposhi in Zambia; Tanzania Railway Corporation (TRC) covering 2,600 km from Dar es Salaam to Kigoma and Mwanza; and the Kenya- Uganda line that runs from Mombasa to Kasese in Uganda covering 1,507.23 km. Also, there is a standard gauge railway under construction in Tanzania which will run from Dar es Salaam-Morogoro (300 km), Morogoro-Dodoma (426 km), Dodoma-Isaka (435 km), Isaka-Mwanza (220 km) to Isaka-Rusumo (371 km). Another railway line under construction is from Mombasa in Kenya to Kigali in Rwanda about 1500 kilometers long.  \nPipeline transport: Pipeline transport refers to the carrying of liquid and gaseous products such as petroleum, natural gas, water and milk over long distances. For example, water supply to residential and commercial areas is distributed through a system of pipes. Pipeline transport is the most convenient and economical means of land transport especially for petroleum and natural gas, compared to road and rail transport.  \nA good example of pipeline transport in Tanzania is the Tanzania-Zambia Mafuta (TAZAMA) pipeline that runs from the port of Dar es Salaam to Ndola in Zambia. Another pipeline transports natural gas from Mnazi Bay in Mtwara to Kinyerezi in Dar es Salaam. Also, Tanzania and Uganda are currently constructing a trans-border pipeline known as the East African Crude Oil Pipeline that will run from Hoima in Uganda to Tanga in Tanzania covering 1,444 km. In Kenya, there is a Kenya- Uganda- Rwanda petroleum products pipeline from Mombasa to Nairobi and Eldoret. The plan is to extend it to Kampala in Uganda and Kigali in Rwanda. Figure 9.6 shows a TAZAMA oil pumping station in Tanzania.  \nFigure 9.6 TAZAMA oil pumping station\nSource: tazama.co.zom-pumping station  \nOther types of land transport include the use of cables and conveyor belts. Cable transport uses cable cars and ski lifts to convey passengers and goods. The run way is made up of cables or ropes. This means of transport is most appropriate in difficult terrain especially mountainous areas such as Switzerland, Poland, Austria and South Africa. Figure 9.7 shows cable transport.  \nFigure 9.7 Cable transport in Cape Town, South Africa\nSource: https://img.theculturetrip.com  \nA conveyor-belt is a continuous moving strip of rubber or metal mostly used in industries, airports, harbours and in mines to move objects along. It can also be called a flexible endless strip of fabric or linked plates driven by rollers to transport goods. The conveyor-belt facilitates the transportation of materials and goods over short distances. Figure 9.8 shows a conveyor-belt transporting coal in a mining industry.  \nFigure 9.8 A conveyor-belt transporting coal\nSource: http://www.iconsteel.net/pages/online/applications coal.coke.fuel  \nAir transport: Air transport is a means of transport that carries passengers and goods through airways. Air transport facilitates integration of the global economy and provides ripe connectivity on a national, regional and international scale. It uses different aircrafts such as passenger aircraft, cargo aircrafts and helicopters. Air transport is the fastest means of transport in the world, that covers long distances within a short time. It is the most appropriate means of transportation for perishable goods. However, it is also one of the most expensive means of transport. Some of the international airports in East Africa include the Julius Nyerere International Airport and Kenyatta International Airport in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, respectively.  \nAir transport is categorised into domestic and international. Domestic air transport is mainly for movement within the same country whereas an international air transport is used for carrying goods and passengers between countries. Figure 9.9 shows an air Tanzania plane.  \nFigure 9.9 An Air Tanzania passenger plane\nSource: airtanzania.com  \nWater transport: Water transport refers to the movement of goods and passengers on waterways through various means such as boats, steamers, dhows and ships. This type of transport takes place on dams, canals, rivers, lakes, seas and oceans. It is usually the cheapest of all modes of transport. This mode of transport is appropriate for bulky goods. There are two forms of water transport: inland and ocean water ways.  \nInland transport is facilitated by ships via inland waterways such as canals, rivers and lakes between inland ports.  \nRivers: The navigable rivers in East Africa include Rufiji, Ruvuma, Mara and Ruvu in Tanzania; Tana, Sondu Mirio and Athi in Kenya; and the Nile in Uganda. Other rivers include Rhone, Elbe, Danube and Rhine in Europe; Ganges, Indus, Hwang-Ho Yangtze Kiang and Si-Kiang in Asia; Congo, Nile, Limpopo and Senegal in Africa; and the Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee in the United States of America. Unfortunately, most of the rivers are of limited use for navigation for the following reasons.  \n- Seasonal fluctuations: The level of water in many rivers varies from one season to another. After heavy rains, these rivers tend to flood. However, during the dry season the water volume decreases, and some rivers almost disappear.\n- Rapids or waterfalls: Many rivers have rapids and waterfalls. These rapids and waterfalls may divide the river into a number of navigable sections, for example, the Congo River.\n- Short, shallow or too swift rivers waters: Many rivers are too short, too shallow or too swift to be useful for navigation. The narrowness of the country or the size of the islands makes rivers of little navigation value; for example, rivers of Japan, Korea; Indonesia, the Philippines and New Zealand, have limited navigation value.\n- Canals: A canal is a long narrow stretch of water artificially made to enable boats and ships to travel along. Examples of canals include the Suez in Egypt, the Panama and Great Lakes of North America joined by canals with Saint Lawrence Seaway, Amsterdam - Rhine and North Sea in Netherlands and the Caledonian in England.\n- Lakes: A lake is a hollow or depression in the Earth\u2019s surface that contains fresh or salty water. Many lakes are artificial as they have been constructed to store water for HEP generation using a dam. Other lakes have been created for aesthetic, recreational, industrial, agricultural and domestic purposes. Examples of lakes in East Africa are Tanganyika, Nyasa, Kivu, Edward, Albert, Rudolf and Victoria. Others are Michigan, Erie, Ontario, Huron and Superior in North America. Figure 9.10 shows a cargo ship carrying a passenger boat. Figure 9.11 shows a passenger boat.  \nFigure 9.10 A container ship\nFigure 9.11 A passenger boat  \n- Oceans: Major ocean shipping routes in the world ocean shipping services transport more than 80 percent of all globally traded products. Marine trade contributes greatly to international trade. For example, vehicles, clothes, fuel, electronic equipment such as TV sets are carried from various manufacturing industries of the world to the market using ships. There are several shipping routes for ocean vessels to ensure a quick and safe delivery of the goods. Some of these world shipping routes are described below.  \n- North Atlantic route: This is the busiest sea route in the world connecting the major ports of Amsterdam, London, Rotterdam, Lisbon and Oslo. These are the popular heavily industrialised parts of the world. The route links North Eastern USA, and North Western Europe, the two most developed regions of the world. The major ports on this route are London, Hamburg, Liverpool, Glasgow, Rotterdam, Southampton, Copenhagen, Lisbon, Stockholm and Oslo.  \n- The English Channel: This separates England from France, connecting the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean. It is today one of the busiest shipping routes on the planet. It is approximately 350 miles long. About 500 ships travel via the channel daily, hence making it a critical route in the European shipping network.\n- Strait of Malacca: This is the shortest route between the Pacific and Indian oceans. It links major Asian economies such as India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Japan, China, South Korea and Taiwan. The Strait of Malacca is the world\u2019s second busiest water way with more than 83,000 vessels taking this route each year. Goods transported through this strait include coal, palm oil, Indonesian coffee and liquefied natural gas. The Malacca water ways connect the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea (Pacific Ocean).\n- Suez Canal: The Suez Canal is commonly known as the Highway to India. Suez Canal is a manually constructed canal which creates the shortest maritime route between the Atlantic and Indian oceans. The route stretches from the Port of Sea in Egypt, through the Mediterranean sea to the Port of Suez at the Red Sea, and manufactured products pass through connecting Europe and Asia without navigating around Africa. It is one of the world\u2019s most heavily used shipping lanes with more than 100 vessels traversing it every day. More than 900,000 tonnes of cargo travel through the canal. Major commodities transported are petroleum, coal, metals, wood, oil seeds, cement, and fertilizers.\n- Saint Lawrence Seaway: This is the most important shipping lane in North America which connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River form the longest deep-draft navigation system in the world. It extends about 2,300 miles into North America and directly serves Ontario and Quebec (in Canada), Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, New York, and Pennsylvania (in the United States of America). The Seaway is named after Saint Lawrence River which flows from Lake Ontario to the Atlantic Ocean. Yearly, more than 350,000 tonnes of raw materials, agricultural commodities and manufactured products pass through this route.\n- The Panama Canal: This is an artificial passageway designed to reduce transit time between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The Panama Canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans across the Isthmus of Panama. The Canal is about 80 km long. More than 14,000 ships navigate the Panama Canal each year, carrying vegetable oil and fats, canned and refrigerated foods, chemicals and petroleum chemicals, lumber machinery parts, and grains.\n- The Cape of Good Hope: This route connects Europe and Africa passing by the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Agulhas at the Southern edge of Africa. It is also known as the sea route to India. It is important to the east and far west as it facilitates the transportation of tropical raw materials from Africa to Europe and the rest of the world and manufactured goods from Europe to Africa.

The following sections explain the importance of transport in East Africa.  \n- Facilitating the availability of goods to customers: Transport makes it possible for the easy and quick movement of goods from one place to another. Thus, consumers spread in different parts of the country have the benefit of consuming goods produced at various distant places.\n- Making available raw materials to manufacturers or producers: Transport makes it possible to carry raw materials from places where they are available, to places where they can be processed and assembled into finished goods.\n- Creation of employment opportunities: The transport sector generates employment opportunities for drivers, conductors, pilots, cabin crew, and ship captains. In addition, it creates jobs for people indirectly in the industries that make various parts or machines and other transport equipment as well as those involved in construction and maintenance.\n- Enhancing the standard of living: Easy means of transport facilitates large-scale production of goods at a low cost. It gives consumers opportunity to choose from a variety of goods. As such, transport helps to raise the standards of living for the people.\n- Facilitating movement during emergencies and natural calamities: During crises, such as war or internal disturbances such as earthquakes, floods and fire outbreaks, transport helps to quicken the movement of troops and relief supplies needed in the rescure operation.\n- Helping labour mobility: Transport helps in providing mobility to workers. It facilitates movement of workers from one country to another country, to work in different economic sectors.\n- Promotion of international relations: Transport facilitates the movement of people from one country to another. It helps promote the exchange of cultures, views and practises between people of different nationalities. This exchange brings about greater understanding among the people and awareness about different countries and their cultures. Thus, it helps to promote a feeling of international brotherhood.

Road transport is flexible and quick, and it can connect many places. Likewise, construction and maintenance of roads is cheaper than railways.  \nRailway transport has the capacity to carry both heavy and bulky goods as well as passengers. The standard gauge railway train is faster and saves time too. Air transport is fast and suitable to use, and it cannot be affected by physical barriers.  \nApart from having advantages the transport sector also faces disadvantages. For example, air transport is very expensive and it needs trained and skilled personnel. In addition, it depends a lot on the weather of the day; if the weather is bad the journey can be postponed. Pipelines are expensive to develop and they are selective in transporting goods. Only fluid materials and natural gases are transported via pipelines.  \nRailway transport is not flexible and it takes long to reach the destination. For example, it takes almost three days to reach Kigoma from Dar es Salaam. Vehicles emit gases which are harmful to living organisms and the atmosphere. Their mobility can also be easily affected by weather conditions, especially during the rainy season when many roads in the rural areas become impassable.",

        "page_content": "### Challenges facing the transport industry in East Africa:  \nThe East African governments have made efforts to develop an adequate, safe, secure and affordable transport system that is aimed to eradicate poverty and bring about sustainable development. Despite these concerted efforts, the transport sector experiences several challenges and constraints as discussed in the subsequent sections.  \n- Inappropriate national policies and their limited implementation: The transport industry suffers from inappropriate and badly-formulated policies which in turn slow down the implementation of sub-regional and regional agreements. In addition, these countries lack policies that allow and promote private sector participation in transport infrastructure development and operation.  \n- Liberalisation and privatisation in rail, air, and maritime transport are still in their infancy: Efforts to harmonise policies and regulations pertaining to cross-border movement of goods, services, and people have yet to become effective. Therefore, the East African countries have not fully implemented agreements aimed to facilitate cross-border movement of goods and passengers.  \n- Lack or poor transport network connectivity: The transport sector in East Africa suffers from a poor transport etwork which is characterised by several missing transport networks in each country and between countries. As a result, the majority of rural population live without access to markets and essential economic and social services. In addition, a large proportion of the transport network is also in poor state.  \n- Inadequate human and institutional capacity: Although the number of workers in East African public transport enterprises and agencies is relatively high, the availability of skilled personnel is limited in most transport organisations. In addition to lack of adequate skilled human resources, institutions also lack people with appropriate knowledge and skills to plan, and manage infrastructural development and services.\n- High transport costs: East Africa is one of the regions with the highest transport costs in the world. Transport services are unaffordable to many African citizens.\n- Poor transport safety and security: The prevailing poor road safety remains a serious challenge in East Africa. Accidents and the resulting loss of life and destruction of property have assumed intolerable proportions. A major weakness in this area is associated with lack of responsible personnel for road safety. In many cases, the major constraint common to all the weaknesses identified in the management of road safety is the lack of adequate financial resources. The poor safety record of many East African airlines is another area of major concern in Africa.\n- Poor transport information systems: Statistical information is a key input at every stage of the development process, including planning and implementation of programmes and projects. Adequate and well-organised statistical information provides tools for making informed decisions in identifying gaps, formulating policies and strategies, developing effective investment programmes and in effective monitoring and evaluation. However, in East Africa, the availability of such data is limited and poorly organised. Likewise, despite the importance of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) the transport sector has not taken full advantage of the technology due to lack of a proper policy for ICT development and integration in transport.\n- Limited financial resources: Despite efforts made by East African governments and international and domestic development partners to mobilise financial resources for investing in transport infrastructure and maintenance of the existing facilities, huge gaps remain between the demand and supply of resources. Sustainable transport development requires huge financial outlays to build infrastructure, and provide energy-efficient and environmental-friendly transport equipment, among others.",

        "page_content": "### Measures to address transport challenges in Tanzania:  \nTanzania needs to take several initiatives in a bid to address the transport challenges facing the country. Such initiatives should focus on policy, strategy, resource mobilisation and capacity-building. The initiatives aim at translating policies and strategies into action. The following sections present some of the measures aimed to address the identified challenges.  \n- National policies and sub-regional and regional agreements: Tanzania has to demonstrate its commitment in improving the domestic investment environment by taking necessary steps. The actions need to target full liberalisation of the transport sector to attract investors, and strengthening the regulatory and enforcement mechanisms. In addition, improving co-ordination in developing and implementing regional and sub-regional agreements on transport facilitation and air transport liberalisation should be seriously considered.\n- Human and institutional capacity building: Efforts should be directed towards institutions to ensure that they have appropriate mandates and are staffed with highly motivated and skilled human resources. These measures should involve key elements in the development of a safe, secure, affordable and environmentally-sound transport system. Also, responsible authorities need to develop and implement capacity building programmes to upgrade the knowledge and skills of staff involved in policy formulation, planning and implementation as well as those engaged in regulatory and enforcement functions.\n- Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA): The development of a sustainable transport system, requires carrying out an environmental impact assessment. This assessment should be incorporated into the infrastructure development plans of the country. In this regard, any plan for transport construction should undergo EIA processes before approval.\n- Energy efficiency and transport cost: Transport services in Tanzania are associated with high costs due to inadequate and poor infrastructure, poor transport facilities as well as limited competition.\n- Transport safety and security: The government of Tanzania needs to plan for initiatives aimed to improve safety in all modes of transport. This can be done by establishing effective institutional frameworks and strengthening the existing frameworks to manage traffic and ensure safety. Moreover, there is a need to ensure compliance with safety and security regulations and standards established by relevant local, international and regional authorities.\n- Transport information systems: Given the high demand for the use of information in the transport sector and inadequacy of necessary information in the country, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) offers a powerful tool for accessing, processing and disseminating large volumes of information in the shortest time possible.\n- Financial resources: Despite the efforts made by the government to allocate funds for transport development, the amount is far below what is actually required to finance and maintain the existing transport network. Thus, there is a need to engage the private sector in infrastructure development. The involvement of the private sector in infrastructural development and operations can help ease public resource constraints. The private sector has the potential of enhancing the productivity and efficiency of infrastructure services. This calls for improving the investment climate by updating institutional and regulatory frameworks and reducing bureaucratic procedures and practices.",
