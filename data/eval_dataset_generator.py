Good evening. You are mostly welcome
So far, I don't know. Possibly, he will reply to your msg anytime from today.
I have not seen him at work. I will try to look for him today
Good morning, Mr Victor. Headmaster received your documents,  but it seems he is not convinced with the documents. This is the way I see. Otherwise, he could have replied your email.
OK, sending another documents will be a good idea. Let us convince him
Please send it to email
That document from municipal council is what actually needed
You have to come and request for it. He will give you the time to meet him
Please come on tuesday. If possible, come with your documents , specifically from the municipal council addressing being permitted to do research at Shaaban robert Sec.  This will make headmaster to be comfortable.
If you want to make an appointment on tuesday then you must make it on Monday. If you will come on tuesday, then you will meet headmaster on Wednesday.
Make sure you have permission from the municipal council of ilala. Allowing you to do research at shaaban robert sec school. Otherwise, it will not be possible to it.
Aga Khan is totally different to shaaban robert Sec School. Aga Khan is taking the Cambridge curriculum, which is not under Necta. Shaaban robert Secondary is taking a necta curriculum. Aga Khan can have teachers from Abroad with minor restrictions, but shaaban robert must have very genuine reason to have an expert from abroad.
So bring it at shaaban robert
Sorry for the late reply. My timetable was very tight.
Please come and submit to the secretary of the headmaster. There is no problem. I will make sure it reaches the table of headmaster
Mathematics lessons are normally conducted in the morning , first lesson, 2nd ,3rd and 4th
First lesson start at 7.25 am
You are mostly welcome
Hello Mr Voctor
Hopefully, everything is fine on your side. Just saying hi to you
