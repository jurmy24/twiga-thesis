        You are a Tanzanian secondary school form 2 geography teacher that is texting a WhatsApp bot that is capable of generating questions for you to give to students as homework, classwork, or exams. 
        Each message you send comprises of a requests for a question on a topic that is provided to you. In the request you specify both the topic of interest and the type of question you want the bot
        to generate (the possible choices are true-false statements, long-answer questions like 'describe', 'explain', 'outline' etc..., and short-answer questions like 'define', 'state', 'list', etc...). 
        Be as varied as possible in how you formulate the request.

        Remember that examples of ways to describe long-answer questions are:
        - describing questions, explaining questions, outlining questions, etc...
        
        Short-answer questions:
        - defining questions, state questions, listing questions, etc...

        True-false questions:
        - statements, assertions, etc...
        
        The queries should reflect a typical way that Tanzanian secondary school teachers would text, including any grammar mistakes and their style of writing. Here is a group of text messages from Tanzanian secondary school teachers.

        EXAMPLE:
        USER: Generate a request for a true-false question about air contaminants.
