True or false: Rice cultivation requires flooded conditions with the depth of water varying between 25 mm at the time of transplanting to 150 mm for 10 weeks of the growing period.,"##### Conditions for growing rice:  
Rice is a tropical crop which grows well where the average temperature during the growing season is between 20°C and 27°C. Abundant sunshine is also essential during its four months of growth. The minimum temperature should not go below 15°C as germination cannot take place below that temperature. Rice requires more water than any other crop. As a result, paddy cultivation is done only in those areas where minimum rainfall is 1,150 mm. Paddy also needs flooded conditions with the depth of water varying over 25 mm at the time of transplanting to as much as 150 mm for 10 weeks of the growing period.

Define post-harvest processing of tea.,"#### Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation of tea:  
It takes two years for tea plants to be ready for harvesting. Picking of tea leaves requires experience because if it is done poorly, it may result in low-quality tea. Tea plants are normally plucked for 3-4 years after which all old branches are pruned for new shoots to grow. The plucked tea leaves undergo fermentation under regulated moisture to ensure quality tea product. Thereafter, tea leaves are rolled to enhance the breakup of the leaf cells and fibres. The leaves are then dried in temperatures of about 105°C. This process is called roasting or firing. Roasting stops fermentation and reduces moisture. Cool and dried tea is sorted in different sizes and graded. Unwanted particles are removed before packing. At this stage, tea is ready for consumption and export.

What are the steps involved in the post-harvest processing of tea according to the provided context in Geography Form 2?,"#### Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation of tea:  
It takes two years for tea plants to be ready for harvesting. Picking of tea leaves requires experience because if it is done poorly, it may result in low-quality tea. Tea plants are normally plucked for 3-4 years after which all old branches are pruned for new shoots to grow. The plucked tea leaves undergo fermentation under regulated moisture to ensure quality tea product. Thereafter, tea leaves are rolled to enhance the breakup of the leaf cells and fibres. The leaves are then dried in temperatures of about 105°C. This process is called roasting or firing. Roasting stops fermentation and reduces moisture. Cool and dried tea is sorted in different sizes and graded. Unwanted particles are removed before packing. At this stage, tea is ready for consumption and export.

Nomadic pastoralism suffers from lack of processing and storage facilities, hence causing a significant loss of the products. Also, over-grazing under nomadic pastoralism leads to soil erosion. Moreover, the control of diseases is difficult since animals are always on the move, which can affect the health of the animals and lower productivity in the process. For example, there have been cases of loss of large numbers of livestock due to lack of water and pasture. This situation affects the economy of the pastoralists. Furthermore, the practise of nomadic pastoralism tends to cause conflicts as they interfere with crop cultivators’ land.

"What are some of the main challenges facing the forestry industry in Tanzania, and how do these challenges impact the sustainability of forest resources in the country?","Although forest resources contribute to the welfare of people, the forestry industry faces numerous challenges. Over-exploitation of forest resources is one of the challenges. Forest resources are harvested to the point of reducing their ability to regenerate. For example, some forest tree species, especially natural trees, are usually in high demand. The demand compels over-harvesting of such forest resources so much so that they face extinction. In some cases, forests are harvested without following governing procedures and, consequently, some tree species may disappear. Experience indicates that ungoverned exploitation is usually serious in public-owned natural forests than in private planted forests. Forests also face the problem of fire outbreaks with some fires occurring naturally while others are set by people. The fire, particularly during late burning, destroys trees and the undergrowth, which are the main constituents of forests. Estimates indicate that each year fires burn",0.7868208408355712,"With examples, mention problems facing forests resource harvesting.",0.3003581762313843

Explain how overgrazing can negatively impact the environment and the livelihood of nomadic pastoralists.,"#### Characteristics of nomadic pastoralism:  
The nomads normally move in groups. These groups are formed through the integration of families or members of a given ethnic group. A group involves a chief or elders who make decisions for the entire group. Indeed, large herd tends to cause overgrazing. Overgrazing is a situation where the number of cattle is greater than the carrying capacity of the grazing land. As a result, overgrazing causes soil erosion, land degradation, and loss of valuable species. Another feature of the nomadic pastoralists is the breeding process, which is uncontrolled. This situation may lead to the spread and outbreak of animal diseases, hence low animal quality and deaths.  
In addition, there is poor control of pests and other diseases, which result to poor quality of animal products. Furthermore, nomadic pastoralism takes place where the population is scarce as the animals are grazed in open range, which needs a lot of space.",0.7697291731834411,Explain what nomadic pastoralism means.,0.2699000000953674

Automatic irrigation and agricultural machinery require fossil fuels and other sources of energy to run them. The increase in the price of fossil fuel, therefore, increases the cost of production. At times, there is a shortage of water as irrigation requires a lot of water. The amount of underground water drawn for irrigation is increasing whereas the amount of water to refill is decreasing; which results in shortage of water for agricultural use. Another problem has to do with loss of soil fertility as the soil is eroded faster than it can be replenished due to over- cultivation. Also, over-irrigation causes leaching of soil nutrients.",0.8090303897857666,Mention five major challenges facing large-scale agriculture in the USA.,0.35054985284805296

Explain the post-harvest processing stages of tea in detail according to the information provided in the textbook.,"#### Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation of tea:  
It takes two years for tea plants to be ready for harvesting. Picking of tea leaves requires experience because if it is done poorly, it may result in low-quality tea. Tea plants are normally plucked for 3-4 years after which all old branches are pruned for new shoots to grow. The plucked tea leaves undergo fermentation under regulated moisture to ensure quality tea product. Thereafter, tea leaves are rolled to enhance the breakup of the leaf cells and fibres. The leaves are then dried in temperatures of about 105°C. This process is called roasting or firing. Roasting stops fermentation and reduces moisture. Cool and dried tea is sorted in different sizes and graded. Unwanted particles are removed before packing. At this stage, tea is ready for consumption and export.

What are some of the disadvantages associated with nomadic pastoralism according to the textbook information provided?,"#### Characteristics of nomadic pastoralism:  
The nomads normally move in groups. These groups are formed through the integration of families or members of a given ethnic group. A group involves a chief or elders who make decisions for the entire group. Indeed, large herd tends to cause overgrazing. Overgrazing is a situation where the number of cattle is greater than the carrying capacity of the grazing land. As a result, overgrazing causes soil erosion, land degradation, and loss of valuable species. Another feature of the nomadic pastoralists is the breeding process, which is uncontrolled. This situation may lead to the spread and outbreak of animal diseases, hence low animal quality and deaths.  
In addition, there is poor control of pests and other diseases, which result to poor quality of animal products. Furthermore, nomadic pastoralism takes place where the population is scarce as the animals are grazed in open range, which needs a lot of space.",0.7472592115402221,Explain what nomadic pastoralism means.,0.2608853101730347

3. Subsistence farmers grow food crops primarily for commercial purposes and profit.
4. Small-scale crop cultivation is often practiced by families who own small pieces of land ranging from one to five hectares.
5. Subsistence farming can lead to famine if","#### Small-scale crop cultivation:  
Small-scale crop cultivation is the growing of crops on a small piece of land. It is also called subsistence farming. It aims to produce enough food for the wellbeing of families. In some instances, when the production is high, the surplus is sold. Individuals engaging in small-scale crop cultivation are known as peasants. They are also called subsistence farmers as they grow food crops to feed themselves and their families with little or no surplus for sale.  
As noted earlier, the agricultural system at subsistence level falls under this category. A farmer owns a small piece of land for food crops cultivation. The produce is enough only for the family. It is hand to mouth existence which may lead to famine if the harvest is bad. In years with good harvest the farmer may have surplus to sell to the local markets. The farms are small, about one to five hectares owned by the family. Application of machines is difficult as farms are small.",0.893894612789154,"Write True or False for the following statement:

True or False: The recommended depth for ploughing the land before planting sisal is 30 cm.,"### Sisal  
Sisal is a tropical plant whose leaves produce strong threads (fibres) which are used for various purposes such as rope and carpet making. Sisal was originally grown in southern Mexico. Subsequently, it has been widely cultivated in many other countries. In fact, it has widely been introduced in the tropics and subtropics. In Tanzania, sisal was introduced in 1893 by Dr Richard Hindorf and the first 62 sisal plants were planted near Pangani in Tanga Region. Until the 1960s, Tanzania was the leading producer of sisal, but since then Brazil has become the major world producer of sisal, followed by Tanzania, Kenya, Madagascar and China. In Tanzania, sisal is grown in Tanga, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Morogoro, Lindi and Mtwara regions.

"Explain the impact of large-scale mining on biodiversity, using specific examples to support your answer.","- Deforestation and loss of biodiversity: Large-scale mining involves clearing of forests and any other vegetation cover. The clearance of vegetation causes the loss of different plant and animal species. Mining causes direct and indirect damage to wild animals by altering their habitats. This may lead to the disappearance of various wildlife species such as birds and other animals.
- Loss of soil productivity: Rocky soils left behind after mining cannot support crop production because they have low fertility. In fact, the soil structure and texture is destroyed when it mixes with particles of rocks.
- Effects on the water table: Deep mining that reaches the water table may cause underground water to flood the mines. As a result, the water has to be pumped out to allow mining to continue. Continued pumping of this underground water lowers the water table of the area.",0.7330912590026856,Explain the role of mass media in forest conservation.,0.30612810850143435

Explain three challenges faced in river basin projects according to the context provided.,"#### Challenges facing river basin projects  
River basin projects face numerous challenges. Many of these challenges are caused by natural events and human activitiesthattakeplaceinthebasins. These are described below.  
##### Siltation  
Siltation is one of the challenges facing river basin projects. The water in dams depends on the supply of water from highland areas through streams and rivers. Usually streams flowing into dams carry some sediments which ultimately accumulate in the dams. This accumulation of sediments leads to a decrease in the volume of water which may have numerous impacts. These impacts may include lowering the ability of dams to produce enough water necessary for electricity generation, in addition to affecting transport and destroying marine organisms.
