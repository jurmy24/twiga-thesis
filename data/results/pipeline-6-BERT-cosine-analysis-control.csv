Large-scale crop cultivation is characterized by cultivation of a large area with the application of high level of technology. The technology involves the use of tractors, combine harvesters, and processing machines. As large-scale farming is highly mechanized, it employs few skilled people because machines carry out agricultural activities that otherwise could have been done manually by humans.  
In addition, such commercial farming is capital-intensive to support the production. Also, it is often based on a single crop, a practise known as monoculture. Chemical fertilisers are highly used to maximise yields. Large-scale agriculture is basically a source of raw materials for different manufacturing industries.

Sisal is a tropical plant whose leaves produce strong threads (fibres) which are used for various purposes such as rope and carpet making. Sisal was originally grown in southern Mexico. Subsequently, it has been widely cultivated in many other countries. In fact, it has widely been introduced in the tropics and subtropics. In Tanzania, sisal was introduced in 1893 by Dr Richard Hindorf and the first 62 sisal plants were planted near Pangani in Tanga Region. Until the 1960s, Tanzania was the leading producer of sisal, but since then Brazil has become the major world producer of sisal, followed by Tanzania, Kenya, Madagascar and China. In Tanzania, sisal is grown in Tanga, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Morogoro, Lindi and Mtwara regions.
