"Here is a true or false statement about rice cultivation for the upcoming geography test:

Rice can be grown in areas with a minimum rainfall of 500 mm. (False)","##### Conditions for growing rice:  
Rice is a tropical crop which grows well where the average temperature during the growing season is between 20°C and 27°C. Abundant sunshine is also essential during its four months of growth. The minimum temperature should not go below 15°C as germination cannot take place below that temperature. Rice requires more water than any other crop. As a result, paddy cultivation is done only in those areas where minimum rainfall is 1,150 mm. Paddy also needs flooded conditions with the depth of water varying over 25 mm at the time of transplanting to as much as 150 mm for 10 weeks of the growing period.

There are several challenges facing large-scale agriculture in the USA. Some of them are high cost of production as agriculture in the USA is highly mechanised. Automatic irrigation and agricultural machinery require fossil fuels and other sources of energy to run them. The increase in the price of fossil fuel, therefore, increases the cost of production. At times, there is a shortage of water as irrigation requires a lot of water. The amount of underground water drawn for irrigation is increasing whereas the amount of water to refill is decreasing; which results in shortage of water for agricultural use. Another problem has to do with loss of soil fertility as the soil is eroded faster than it can be replenished due to over- cultivation.

What are the two processes that tea leaves undergo to enhance the breakup of the leaf cells and fibres during post-harvest processing?,"#### Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation of tea:  
It takes two years for tea plants to be ready for harvesting. Picking of tea leaves requires experience because if it is done poorly, it may result in low-quality tea. Tea plants are normally plucked for 3-4 years after which all old branches are pruned for new shoots to grow. The plucked tea leaves undergo fermentation under regulated moisture to ensure quality tea product. Thereafter, tea leaves are rolled to enhance the breakup of the leaf cells and fibres. The leaves are then dried in temperatures of about 105°C. This process is called roasting or firing. Roasting stops fermentation and reduces moisture. Cool and dried tea is sorted in different sizes and graded. Unwanted particles are removed before packing. At this stage, tea is ready for consumption and export.

Population growth is an increase in the number of people in a particular area. Rapid population growth could be due to natural increase or in-migration. The rapid population growth puts more pressure on small-scale farmers. Yet, subsistence farmers are not likely to raise their output to feed the growing numbers because of lack of capital. Subsequently, land becomes overpopulated and resources overused. Also high population growth is associated with smaller farms and lower farm wages. As a result households in densely populated areas increasingly rely on off-farm income.",tensor(0.4229),tensor(0.6222),tensor(0.5027),Mention the effects of rapid population growth on small-scale crop cultivation.,tensor(0.7560),tensor(0.7082),tensor(0.7311)

Large-scale crop cultivation is characterized by cultivation of a large area with the application of high level of technology. The technology involves the use of tractors, combine harvesters, and processing machines. As large-scale farming is highly mechanized, it employs few skilled people because machines carry out agricultural activities that otherwise could have been done manually by humans.  
In addition, such commercial farming is capital-intensive to support the production. Also, it is often based on a single crop, a practise known as monoculture. Chemical fertilisers are highly used to maximise yields. Large-scale agriculture is basically a source of raw materials for different manufacturing industries.

"What are the characteristics of nomadic pastoralism that distinguish it from other forms of agriculture, and how do these characteristics affect the environment and the pastoralists themselves?","#### Characteristics of nomadic pastoralism:  
The nomads normally move in groups. These groups are formed through the integration of families or members of a given ethnic group. A group involves a chief or elders who make decisions for the entire group. Indeed, large herd tends to cause overgrazing. Overgrazing is a situation where the number of cattle is greater than the carrying capacity of the grazing land. As a result, overgrazing causes soil erosion, land degradation, and loss of valuable species. Another feature of the nomadic pastoralists is the breeding process, which is uncontrolled. This situation may lead to the spread and outbreak of animal diseases, hence low animal quality and deaths.  
In addition, there is poor control of pests and other diseases, which result to poor quality of animal products. Furthermore, nomadic pastoralism takes place where the population is scarce as the animals are grazed in open range, which needs a lot of space.",tensor(0.4649),tensor(0.5180),tensor(0.4840),Explain what nomadic pastoralism means.,tensor(0.4882),tensor(0.4411),tensor(0.4546)

"Here is a long-answer exercise on Post-harvest processing of tea:

Describe the stages involved in the post-harvest processing of tea, highlighting the importance of each stage in producing high-quality tea.","#### Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation of tea:  
It takes two years for tea plants to be ready for harvesting. Picking of tea leaves requires experience because if it is done poorly, it may result in low-quality tea. Tea plants are normally plucked for 3-4 years after which all old branches are pruned for new shoots to grow. The plucked tea leaves undergo fermentation under regulated moisture to ensure quality tea product. Thereafter, tea leaves are rolled to enhance the breakup of the leaf cells and fibres. The leaves are then dried in temperatures of about 105°C. This process is called roasting or firing. Roasting stops fermentation and reduces moisture. Cool and dried tea is sorted in different sizes and graded. Unwanted particles are removed before packing. At this stage, tea is ready for consumption and export.

Explain two environmental problems associated with oil production in the Middle East.,"Oil production in the Middle East faces many challenges. With rising global demand, highly volatile prices are increasingly becoming stringent. The oil and gas industry faces three major challenges involving how to reduce costs, optimize the performance of its industrial base assets, and address its environmental footprint. Environmental pollution is one of these challenges. Oil refinery and production of petroleum products produce carbon dioxide and other gases such as methane which are harmful. As countries in the Middle East have large oil production industries, the emission of harmful gases is also high. These gases contribute to the pollution of water, air, and land. Burning fossil fuels produces sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. When they move into the atmosphere they produce acid rain, which damages buildings and vegetation in addition to affecting fish and other organisms that live in water.

Large-scale farming requires a large capital investment to buy machinery and farm inputs, prepare land and pay farm labourers. It also relies on seasonal rainfall. Climatic changes have largely affected the amount of rainfall in many areas of Tanzania. Since the majority of large-scale farmers in Tanzania rely on rain-fed agriculture, whenever there is a shortage of rainfall, agricultural production falls. Agricultural products from large-scale crop cultivation in Tanzania such as tea, sisal and coffee face stiff competition from other countries that produce the same crops. As a result, prices of such products tend to be low. In addition, large-scale crop cultivation in Tanzania has to contend with pests and diseases.

Subsequently, it has been widely cultivated in many other countries. In fact, it has widely been introduced in the tropics and subtropics. In Tanzania, sisal was introduced in 1893 by Dr Richard Hindorf and the first 62 sisal plants were planted near Pangani in Tanga Region. Until the 1960s, Tanzania was the leading producer of sisal, but since then Brazil has become the major world producer of sisal, followed by Tanzania, Kenya, Madagascar and China. In Tanzania, sisal is grown in Tanga, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Morogoro, Lindi and Mtwara regions.

"Here is a long-answer question on Conservation of biodiversity that requires students to explain deeply:

Explain the importance of protecting biodiversity in Tanzania, highlighting the consequences of its loss, and suggesting ways to conserve it.","- Deforestation and loss of biodiversity: Large-scale mining involves clearing of forests and any other vegetation cover. The clearance of vegetation causes the loss of different plant and animal species. Mining causes direct and indirect damage to wild animals by altering their habitats. This may lead to the disappearance of various wildlife species such as birds and other animals.
- Loss of soil productivity: Rocky soils left behind after mining cannot support crop production because they have low fertility. In fact, the soil structure and texture is destroyed when it mixes with particles of rocks.
- Effects on the water table: Deep mining that reaches the water table may cause underground water to flood the mines. As a result, the water has to be pumped out to allow mining to continue. Continued pumping of this underground water lowers the water table of the area.",tensor(0.4465),tensor(0.4831),tensor(0.4633),Explain the role of mass media in forest conservation.,tensor(0.5199),tensor(0.4552),tensor(0.4849)
"What are some of the measures that Tanzania can take to enhance transportation in the country, according to the National policies and sub-regional and regional agreements?","### Measures to address transport challenges in Tanzania:  
Tanzania needs to take several initiatives in a bid to address the transport challenges facing the country. Such initiatives should focus on policy, strategy, resource mobilisation and capacity-building. The initiatives aim at translating policies and strategies into action. The following sections present some of the measures aimed to address the identified challenges.  
- National policies and sub-regional and regional agreements: Tanzania has to demonstrate its commitment in improving the domestic investment environment by taking necessary steps. The actions need to target full liberalisation of the transport sector to attract investors, and strengthening the regulatory and enforcement mechanisms. In addition, improving co-ordination in developing and implementing regional and sub-regional agreements on transport facilitation and air transport liberalisation should be seriously considered.",tensor(0.4552),tensor(0.5565),tensor(0.5004),Suggest what should be done to address the challenges facing the transport sector in Tanzania.,tensor(0.5890),tensor(0.4900),tensor(0.5349)
"Explain the challenges faced by authorities in implementing river basin projects, using examples from siltation, water pollution, costs, and trans-boundary conflicts.","#### Challenges facing river basin projects  
River basin projects face numerous challenges. Many of these challenges are caused by natural events and human activitiesthattakeplaceinthebasins. These are described below.  
##### Siltation  
Siltation is one of the challenges facing river basin projects. The water in dams depends on the supply of water from highland areas through streams and rivers. Usually streams flowing into dams carry some sediments which ultimately accumulate in the dams. This accumulation of sediments leads to a decrease in the volume of water which may have numerous impacts. These impacts may include lowering the ability of dams to produce enough water necessary for electricity generation, in addition to affecting transport and destroying marine organisms.
