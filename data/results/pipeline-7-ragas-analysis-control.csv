The technology involves the use of tractors, combine harvesters, and processing machines. As large-scale farming is highly mechanized, it employs few skilled people because machines carry out agricultural activities that otherwise could have been done manually by humans.  \nIn addition, such commercial farming is capital-intensive to support the production. Also, it is often based on a single crop, a practise known as monoculture. Chemical fertilisers are highly used to maximise yields. Large-scale agriculture is basically a source of raw materials for different manufacturing industries.  \nFigure 2.1 Coffee plant berries  \nsource:https/www.gettyimages.com/photo/coffee-plant'
 'Human beings obtain various products and services from forests. Forest products can be timber and non-timber products that help to sustain human life. Non-timber forest products include fruits, honey, leaves, roots and barks. The process of managing forest resources for human use is known as forestry. Foresters engage in lumbering, which is an activity that involves cutting, transporting, processing and selling timber. The terms ‘timber’ and ‘log’ are used interchangeably to mean branches or pieces of the trunk of a tree, but with the bark attached. Harvesting of forest resources is generally sustainable when there is no or little damage to the general environment. A forest can be natural or planted. Animals, birds and insects use forests to support their lives. Forests provide aesthetic value and services to human beings.'
 'Furthermore, underground water is at times polluted by human activities in their effort to use the land to earn a livelihood. Experience shows that modern farming is characterised by the use of fertilisers, herbicides, insecticides and pesticides. The misuse of these chemicals in farming harms the soil and once rain falls the chemicals contaminate the underground water through infiltration.  \nUnderground water can also be polluted naturally through volcanic eruption. This occurs in areas characterised by eruption of poisonous volcanic materials from the interior of the Earth. The erupted materials finally seep into the soil and mix with underground water. Generally, pollution of underground water is harmful to the lives of people and other living organisms, which directly or indirectly use the water.'
 '#### Negative impact of tourism:  \nThe negative impact of tourism includes the following:  \nTourism has sometimes led to cultural interference and conflicts. Sometimes tourists bring with them practices that are unacceptable to the people in the host country, for example, ways of dressing, food style, and language. Moral decay has occurred in places that are visited by tourists. For example, cases of prostitution, same-sex relationships (homosexuality), and drug abuse have become common in areas with tourist attractions such as beaches and nightclubs.  \nIn addition, tourist activities in national parks and other protected areas may lead to environmental degradation such as off road driving and dumping of waste such as paper and plastics.  \nMoreover, the continued presence of people and vehicles in the tourists sites may lead to change in animal behaviours.'
 '##### Forestry:  \nForestry is a set of practices that involve managing forests for ecological, social, and economic purposes. There are two types of forests: natural and man-made (planted) forests.  \n##### Planted forests:  \nPlanted forests are those in which trees are planted by human beings. They are commonly known as grown trees. The trees may be obtained locally or from other countries. In Tanzania, mahogany and teak are examples of local species whereas pines and eucalyptus are species from other countries. Some examples of planted forests in Tanzania include The Sao Hill forest plantation in Mafinga, Iringa Region and The West Kilimanjaro forest plantation in Kilimanjaro Region.'

The energy can be derived from sunlight, tides, wind, water, geothermal, or hydroelectric action. Likewise, energy produced from the refining of various forms of biomass is often classified as renewable. The renewable energy sources are usually regarded as environmentally friendly because they release few chemicals that can harm the environment. These are energy resources that are naturally reused. Renewable sources are sustainable if they are carefully managed and maintained. They have minimal negative effects on the environment. Renewable energy sources include sunlight, geothermal heat, wind, tides, water, and various forms of biomass. Some of these energy sources are described in the following sub-sections.'
 '#### Transhumance:  \nTranshumance is a seasonal movement of livestock from one grazing ground to another, specifically to lowlands in winter and highlands in summer. It is a form of semi-nomadic pastoralism in which domestic animals play a predominant but not an exclusive role in shaping the economic and cultural life of the people who depend on them.  \nUnder transhumance, pastoralism is a predominant economic activity with varying emphasis on agriculture as a supplementary activity. Countries that practise transhumance include Switzerland, Morocco, Kosovo and the Sudan-Sahelian zone of Mali.  \n##### Advantages of transhumance:'
 'The improvement of transport and communication contributes to easy movement of tourists from one place to another. Tanzania is investing in improving airline transport to strengthen the tourism industry.  \nIn addition, Tanzania has adequate and comfortable accommodation to cater for tourists with different economic status, hence attracting a large number of tourists. Tanzania also has friendly and hospitable people. The country is also rich in cultural diversity with more than 120 ethnic groups.

Tanzania is also well known and respected for its unique language, Kiswahili which is ever expanding in Africa and worldwide.'
 'Leather processing industry includes hides, and skins. Despite its potential to contribute to the economy in terms of employment creation, income generation, foreign earnings and poverty reduction, its current contribution to development is still low. The comprehensive leather sector development strategy of Tanzania endeavours to generate the conditions for a favourable expansion of the industry so as to contribute to overall socio-economic development. Such development will require the coordination of various activities such as the ability of stakeholders to plan and coordinate actions in results. The plants include Moshi industries, Tanzania leather industry, Afro leather, Kibaha Tannery, Himo Tanners and Salex Tanners.'
 '#### Primary activities:  \nPrimary activities are done by people when they interact directly with the natural environment to obtain their essential needs. These activities include agriculture, forestry, mining, and fishing.  \n##### Agriculture:  \nAgriculture is an activity which involves crop cultivation and livestock-keeping. It is the oldest human activity which has been practised by all societies in the world. It provides food for households and raw materials for industries. The type of agriculture practised in a given place is determined by various conditions of the area including climate, water availability, soil characteristics and terrain. It is also influenced by financial resources, infrastructure, technology and conditions of the market.'

Can you make a define question on Animal Behavioral Studies?,Define Animal Behavioral Studies.,"['Nomadic pastoralism involves continual movement of pastoralists with large numbers of animals from place to place in search of pasture and water. People involved in this practice are called nomads or pastoralists. Tribes which practise nomadic pastoralism include the Maasai, Barbaig, Kwavi, and Karamajong. Nomadic pastoralism is mostly practised in sparsely populated areas where the natural vegetation is mainly grass and bushes and, sometimes, scattered trees. In these areas, rainfall is very low and unreliable. The pastoralists follow specific routes in their movements. Figure 2.10 shows a large herd of cattle. The animals kept by pastoralists are a source of food and income through the selling of animals and their products. Major products from animals are meat and milk. The pastoralists spend the money they earn to meet family needs such as buying cereals, paying school fees, and meeting health expenses. In addition, the cattle raised are used for paying bride price and giving gifts'
 '#### Semi-nomadism:  \nSemi-nomadism is a transition between total nomadism and sedentary animal keeping. It involves keeping a large number of animals especially cattle. Tribes which practice semi-nomadism include the Turkana of northern Kenya. The people involved in semi-nomadism usually travel away from their home for long periods during the dry season in search of pasture and water. This season is associated with scarcity of grass and water. Also, the semi-nomads’ movements contribute to the spread of diseases among their livestock. Semi-nomads usually cultivate crops during the rainy season to sustain their lives.'

 'Livestock-keeping is affected by poor transportation for animal products from farms to markets because some areas are inaccessible. In some cases, pastoralists suffer because of unreliable markets and poor storage facilities. As a result of poor transportation networking, especially due to poor and inaccessible roads, their animal-based products get spoiled before reaching the market. However, the market is very limited because of the low purchasing power of the people in some areas. Thislowpurchasingpoweraffectsthe income of livestock-keepers and, as a result, they fail to purchase vaccines for the growth and health of animals. Moreover, insufficient availability of seminars and training on modern livestock-keeping methods lead to low production. In some areas, animals are kept traditionally due to low-level of technology. The changing climate further compromises the availability of water and pasture for the animals.'

 '#### Tanzania’s efforts in addressing the challenges of natural gas production  \nTanzania has been trying to overcome the challenges associated with the production of its natural gas. The government has been emphasising the use of revenue from natural gas to benefit the people in the areas producing the gas and the nation as a whole. The revenue from natural gas is used to improve social services in education and health. There have been various public programmes aimed to educate the public on natural gas benefits. The ministries responsible for energy and mineral resources in Tanzania conduct awareness creation programmes through various ways such as meetings and the media. The government also provides opportunities for training to Tanzanians in oil and natural gas. These training opportunities aim to build the country’s capacity for exploration, extraction, processing and supplying of natural gas.'
 'Medicinal value: Some forest trees have medicinal value. They have roots, leaves, and bark which are used as medicine or processed to make medicine for human beings and animals. For example, the bark of the cinchona tree is used in manufacturing quinine which is useful for treatment of malaria. Also, some trees are used in making herbicides for use in agriculture.  \nTourist attraction: Some forests have rare and unique species of animals and plants which attract people to observe. For example, Gombe Forests in Kigoma have chimpanzees, which are a great attraction for both local and foreign tourists. Many of the natural parks have forests that serve as habitats for attracting animals and plants.  \nRainfall formation: Areas with heavy forests are characterised by frequent rainfall. For example, in the Amazon forests, 30 percent of rainfall is said to be influenced by moist air from trees.'
 '- Creation of employment opportunities: The transport sector generates employment opportunities for drivers, conductors, pilots, cabin crew, and ship captains. In addition, it creates jobs for people indirectly in the industries that make various parts or machines and other transport equipment as well as those involved in construction and maintenance.\n- Enhancing the standard of living: Easy means of transport facilitates large-scale production of goods at a low cost. It gives consumers opportunity to choose from a variety of goods. As such, transport helps to raise the standards of living for the people.\n- Facilitating movement during emergencies and natural calamities: During crises, such as war or internal disturbances such as earthquakes, floods and fire outbreaks, transport helps to quicken the movement of troops and relief supplies needed in the rescure operation.'

 '- Deforestation and loss of biodiversity: Large-scale mining involves clearing of forests and any other vegetation cover. The clearance of vegetation causes the loss of different plant and animal species. Mining causes direct and indirect damage to wild animals by altering their habitats. This may lead to the disappearance of various wildlife species such as birds and other animals.\n- Loss of soil productivity: Rocky soils left behind after mining cannot support crop production because they have low fertility. In fact, the soil structure and texture is destroyed when it mixes with particles of rocks.\n- Effects on the water table: Deep mining that reaches the water table may cause underground water to flood the mines. As a result, the water has to be pumped out to allow mining to continue. Continued pumping of this underground water lowers the water table of the area.'

 'Therefore, to minimise the destruction of the barriers, about 85,000 animals (cattle, goats, sheep, and donkeys) were removed from the area. Afforestation was carried out to hold the soil and check the speed of runoff. The government stopped livestock from using these areas. The government through HADO campaigns also advised people interested in grazing to size down their livestock and try to practise zero-grazing. Significant gains have emerged from HADO initiatives.  \nGenerally, the land has been restored as soil fertility and vegetation in the worst degraded areas have gained a new lease of life.

 'Planting work begins with land preparation as well as the nursery bed for obtaining the seedlings. The seedlings should be planted as young as possible, usually at 20 days. Seeds are planted by removing them from the nursery to the paddy fields. Good rice planting should use the pull to the right and to the left with a distance of 20 cm x 20 cm. This is to enable maintenance, either weeding or fertilising in addition to allowing each plant to receive enough sunlight and nutrients evenly. Seedlings are planted with just one seed in one planting hole. Farmers are required to maintain water and water discharge on paddy fields and weeding (weed control). Irrigating rice crops in rice fields should consider the depth of water in accordance with the age of the plant. Weeds are herbs that live with cultivated plants and are generally very harmful to rice crops. As such, weeding is very important. Fertilisation is done to add nutrients needed by plants in the soil.

 'Water is also a source of electrical power. Modern economies depend much on the supply of electricity. One of the sources of electric power is water to produce what is commonly known as hydroelectric power (HEP). HEP is one of the cheapest and environmentally friendly sources of power. This power is used in industries to run machines, transport goods and provide services as well as in communication systems. Moreover, power contributes to the establishment of small and large-scale economic activities which eventually contribute to the economic growth of a given country. Furthermore, water is useful in the navigation sector in various ways. Human beings navigate different vessels such as canoes, boats, ferries and ships to move people and goods. Transportation of heavy machines for factories and industries, vehicles, timber and logs is made possible on water. In Tanzania, water transport on lakes and oceans facilitates the importation and exportation of various goods such as machines'
 'Reduced over-dependence on fuelwood: The use of biogas reduces over-dependence on fuelwood as a source of energy. In areas where biogas is used, people have reduced the use of fuelwood for heating and cooking. This may in turn reduce deforestation and emission of greenhouse gases.  \nMajor source of electricity: HEP is a major source of electricity, which is widely used in Tanzania. As the government centrally manages HEP by 98 percent, all the regions access it through TANESCO, a public utility company, and puts it into various uses, lighting being the main use.  \nImprovement of standards of living: The availability of biogas and hydro-electric power in rural areas has improved people’s standards of living.

Water from the land is carried by roots to the leaves, a process known as transpiration, and then from the leaves it changes into vapour and moves into the atmosphere through the process of evaporation. The combination of these two processes form what is termed as evapotranspiration (Evaporation + transpiration = evapotranspiration). Evapotranspiration is determined by factors such as temperature, humidity, wind, soil, and type of plants. These factors are hereby explained.'
 '#### Gases:  \nIndustrial activities produce harmful gases that pollute the environment. Such gases are sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon dioxide, methane and other hydrocarbons. The gases emitted may cause respiratory and skin diseases. Sulphur dioxide can form sulphuric acid when it comes into contact with water in the atmosphere to form acid rain. Such rain corrodes rocks, iron sheets and pollute soils, lakes and rivers. Carbon dioxide is produced due to incomplete combustion of gases, oil, coal and wood. The high concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes global warming.'
 '### Condensation  \nCondensation is the process whereby water in its gaseous form changes into liquid. The moist warm air from water bodies and plants moves upwards where there is very low temperature. Then it reaches a dew point (point at which water condenses) and forms clouds. Clouds are masses of water droplets which continue to accumulate and when they are saturated, they become dense and fall as rain. Condensation is a very essential process in the hydrological cycle because it leads to the formation of clouds which produce rainfall (Figure 3.4). Rainfall is the main route through which water returns to the earth’s surface.  \nFigure 3.4 Heavy clouds in the air\nSource: ruvumapress.blogspot.com-mawingu mazito'
 'During photosynthesis, oxygen is released by plants into the environment through the stomata, and this is used by animals. At the same time animals release carbon dioxide that is absorbed by the plants. By doing so, a balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide in the environment is maintained. Forests provide suitable habitats for wildlife and, therefore, contribute to the balance of ecosystem. Various animals live in the forest which gives them shelter and food as they eat leaves, roots and fruits. Moreover, forests help to control soil erosion as they protect the soil from being eroded by blowing wind and running water. Trees in the forest bind together the soil particles using roots, and reduce the impact of raindrops with the same roots. Plant leaves reduce the impact of rain drops on the soil and reduce excessive evaporation of soil water.'
 '### Evaporation  \nEvaporation is the process by which water changes from liquid to gas or vapour. During evaporation, water moves into the atmosphere in the form of water vapour or moisture. Water bodies such as rivers, lakes, seas, and oceans contribute about 90% of the moisture found in the atmosphere through evaporation. Water changes into vapour under the great influence of temperature. Areas with high temperatures and low humidity experience a high rate of evaporation. Evaporation is also determined by humidity and wind.'

 'Coal is a black or brownish-black rock made of organic substances that have been deposited for a long period. The most significant uses of coal are in electricity generation, steel production, cement manufacturing and as a liquid fuel. A number of manufacturing industries use coal to run machines. For example, in Tanzania, coal from Mbinga and Kiwira is used as a source of energy in cement production industries. In addition, the carbon present in coal is an important element when mixed with other chemicals in paper, ink and pencil-making. The carbon in coal is also an ingredient used in drugs and chemical production. For example, aspirin contains some percentages of carbon from coal. Coal is also used in the production of valuable fertilisers that are used in agriculture. Some coal products are useful in making soap, solvents and plastic fibres such as rayon and nylon used for making clothes. Other uses of coal include making construction materials, particularly when it is mixed with'
 'Petroleum and natural gas are used for different purposes in different sectors. Both minerals are sources of power generation. The power generated is used to run machines and engines. For example, most industrial machines, motor-vehicle engines, and generators use petroleum or gas to operate. Crude petroleum is a raw material for producing various products such as kerosene, diesel, petrol, oil and bitumen. Some by-products of petroleum are useful in chemical industries for manufacturing several products such as jelly, synthetic fibres, grease and other lubricants. In addition, petroleum wastes from refineries are used for road surfacing and wood treatment against damage and attack by insects. Natural gas is used for domestic purposes such as heating and cooking. For example, in recent years, Tanzanians have been good users of natural gas for cooking using gas stoves and gas cookers.  \n##### Other important minerals:'
 'For such commercial livestock-keeping, land is managed to control soil erosion. Pasture for grazing and supplementary food also exist. In the meantime, water holes are created to ensure the availability of water for livestock and dips for pest control. Grazing is controlled by dividing the ranch into fenced-off sections known as paddocks.\nUnder this system, cattle move from one paddock to another to ensure that once a paddock has been grazed it has time to recover fully before being used again. Examples of ranches in Tanzania include Ruvu and Kongwa. There are many countries in the world with ranching systems. These countries include Argentina, USA, Northern Australia, Iran, India, China and New Zealand.'
 '### The concept of manufacturing industry  \nThe manufacturing industry involves the processing and changing of raw materials into different semi-finished or finished products using tools and machines.

 'Planting work begins with land preparation as well as the nursery bed for obtaining the seedlings. The seedlings should be planted as young as possible, usually at 20 days. Seeds are planted by removing them from the nursery to the paddy fields. Good rice planting should use the pull to the right and to the left with a distance of 20 cm x 20 cm. This is to enable maintenance, either weeding or fertilising in addition to allowing each plant to receive enough sunlight and nutrients evenly. Seedlings are planted with just one seed in one planting hole. Farmers are required to maintain water and water discharge on paddy fields and weeding (weed control). Irrigating rice crops in rice fields should consider the depth of water in accordance with the age of the plant. Weeds are herbs that live with cultivated plants and are generally very harmful to rice crops. As such, weeding is very important. Fertilisation is done to add nutrients needed by plants in the soil.

 '#### Floatation:  \nFloatation makes possible the processing of complex intergrown ores containing copper, lead, zinc, and pyrite into separate concentrates and tailings. In the floatation, the ores are crushed and the particles separated based on how they float on water or other liquids that allow unwanted materials to remain. For example, processing of copper ore into small particles involves mixing the ore with water. Then chemicals are added to the mixture and put into a floatation machine. The floating copper particles are then removed. The particles are dried and smelted into copper blisters. Copper blisters contain 97% - 98% copper. The blisters can be refined even further to remove other minerals or impurities.'
 'The amount of water supply in a particular area also determines the type of vegetation growth. For example, due to their semi-arid climatic conditions, central parts of Tanzania such as Dodoma and Singida experience little rainfall in a year. The vegetation cover is mainly shrubs with little influence on the formation of rainfall. On the other hand, areas with equatorial climate are covered with thick vegetation (equatorial rainforests). This type of vegetation has a significant influence on rain formation due to high rates of evapotranspiration determined by high temperatures in these regions. High rainfall results in adequate water supply.'

 'Surface mining is done by removing (stripping) surface vegetation, dirt, and, if necessary, layers of bedrock in order to reach buried ore deposits. Techniques of surface mining include: open-pit mining or open cast mining, which is the recovery of materials from an open pit in the ground; and quarrying, identical to open-pit mining except that it refers to sand, stone and clay. Open cast mining is the cheapest method of extracting minerals. This method is used to extract minerals which usually occur close to the earth’s surface. This method involves removing the top layers of the earth and other overlying materials above the mineral ores. Figure 5.3 shows an open cast mine. The extraction involves the use of earth moving machines and bulldozers, and electric shovels. Sometimes explosion is used to blow overlying materials in order to reach the ore beneath.

 '#### Advantages of small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop production is cheap to operate since it involves the use of simple farming tools such as hand hoes and machetes. It is also cheap because the sources of labour are family members and, hence, easy to manage. In addition, small-scale agriculture needs small capital since it operates on small pieces of land. This type of agriculture when integrated with livestock-keeping provides biomass which is useful in the production of biogas energy. This energy is commonly used for cooking. Another advantage of small-scale crop cultivation is that farmers get fresh food such as vegetables and fruits. Therefore, small-scale agriculture contributes to the development of local communities.'

A wind turbine operates on the following simple principles:  \n1. The power from the wind turns the windmill that has two or three propeller-like blades around a rotor.\n2. The motor is connected to a main shaft that spins a generator to generate energy. Figure 8.1 shows a windmill farm.'
 'The PV cells are combined to form solar panels (Figure 8.2). The panels usually differ in size depending on the purpose of their installation. The series of combined PV cells are usually placed on roofs of houses or on top of traffic lights to form the panels, which capture solar energy. For adequate energy to be obtained, solar panels should face the sun so that more sunrays are converted into electrical energy.\nChina, Germany, Italy, the USA, and Japan possess the biggest solar photovoltanic (PV) technology capacity in the world.  \nIn Tanzania, solar energy is used as a source of power by 24.7% of the households that have access to electricity. High potentials of solar energy resources are found in the central parts of the country.'
 'Reduced over-dependence on fuelwood: The use of biogas reduces over-dependence on fuelwood as a source of energy. In areas where biogas is used, people have reduced the use of fuelwood for heating and cooking. This may in turn reduce deforestation and emission of greenhouse gases.  \nMajor source of electricity: HEP is a major source of electricity, which is widely used in Tanzania. As the government centrally manages HEP by 98 percent, all the regions access it through TANESCO, a public utility company, and puts it into various uses, lighting being the main use.  \nImprovement of standards of living: The availability of biogas and hydro-electric power in rural areas has improved people’s standards of living. With power, people have managed to start small projects such as welding, carpentry, and milling. Such projects have become sources of income for the people and have improved their standards of living.'

The energy can be derived from sunlight, tides, wind, water, geothermal, or hydroelectric action. Likewise, energy produced from the refining of various forms of biomass is often classified as renewable. The renewable energy sources are usually regarded as environmentally friendly because they release few chemicals that can harm the environment. These are energy resources that are naturally reused. Renewable sources are sustainable if they are carefully managed and maintained. They have minimal negative effects on the environment. Renewable energy sources include sunlight, geothermal heat, wind, tides, water, and various forms of biomass. Some of these energy sources are described in the following sub-sections.'

 'Power is found within our bodies, machines, in plants and bodies of animals, insects and birds. Power is also inherently present in natural forces like wind, tides, waves, and water whose movements can be utilized to drive machines, or generate electricity. In our daily lives, power is needed to cook food, to drive machinery in industrial plants, to provide light and heat, and to propel vehicles of different types.  \nEnergy: Energy can be defined as the capacity for, or equivalent of, doing work. Energy is the ability to work so as to produce motion. For example, when water turns a turbine, electricity is produced. Also energy is used to drive machines and provide heat and light.  \nThe society requires energy for transportation, heating and cooling of buildings, powering production processes in industry, and various household needs. Energy can be grouped into various types as explained below.'

 'Surface mining is done by removing (stripping) surface vegetation, dirt, and, if necessary, layers of bedrock in order to reach buried ore deposits. Techniques of surface mining include: open-pit mining or open cast mining, which is the recovery of materials from an open pit in the ground; and quarrying, identical to open-pit mining except that it refers to sand, stone and clay. Open cast mining is the cheapest method of extracting minerals. This method is used to extract minerals which usually occur close to the earth’s surface. This method involves removing the top layers of the earth and other overlying materials above the mineral ores. Figure 5.3 shows an open cast mine. The extraction involves the use of earth moving machines and bulldozers, and electric shovels. Sometimes explosion is used to blow overlying materials in order to reach the ore beneath. This method is cheaper because the output is bigger than the costs of running. The open cast method is used to extract quarrying'

 'Water resources are tapped using varying methods in different countries. Fishing is done using traditional as well as modern methods. Mwanza, Kigoma, Ruvuma, the coast of the Indian Ocean and Zanzibar are good examples of areas that exploit fish for domestic and industrial use. Japan is an excellent example of a country that exploits water resources through fish farming.  \nFish can be farmed and harvested in the same way as crops. Fish is carefully tamed in special areas and containers and harvested for domestic use. Other applicable methods depend on the scale of fishing. In many cases, small-scale fishing relies on the use of traditional methods as described below:  \nHand lining method: This consists of a long stick or rod and hook attached to a string. A bait is attached to the hook to attract fish. The fisherman sinks the hook into the water to catch the fish. The method is time-consuming.'
 '#### Methods used in land reclamation  \nMethods used for land reclamation depend on the nature, location, and size of the land to be reclaimed. For example, land may be reclaimed from water bodies, dry land, saline land, and swampy area.  \nThese different types of land require different methods of reclamation as elaborated below:  \n(a) Land affected by stagnant water or covered by water, draining techniques can be applied. The excess water is removed from the land by draining to make it useful for the intended purpose. An example of land reclamation by draining out water is the Zuider Zee Project in the Netherlands. In this project, dykes or high walls were built to enclose seawater and thus prevent it from entering the land. Then, the enclosed water was pumped out. The land obtained is regularly drained to remove salt for farming and settlement use.'

 '### Sisal  \nSisal is a tropical plant whose leaves produce strong threads (fibres) which are used for various purposes such as rope and carpet making. Sisal was originally grown in southern Mexico. Subsequently, it has been widely cultivated in many other countries. In fact, it has widely been introduced in the tropics and subtropics. In Tanzania, sisal was introduced in 1893 by Dr Richard Hindorf and the first 62 sisal plants were planted near Pangani in Tanga Region. Until the 1960s, Tanzania was the leading producer of sisal, but since then Brazil has become the major world producer of sisal, followed by Tanzania, Kenya, Madagascar and China. In Tanzania, sisal is grown in Tanga, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Morogoro, Lindi and Mtwara regions.  \nFigure 2.7 Sisal farm in Tanga  \nSource: https://www.ippmedia.com/en/news/strategising-restore-sisal-cash-crop-day'
 '### Clove:  \nClove is an evergreen tree of humid tropical climate (Figure 2.8). Its flower buds are spices used in food, drinks and medicine.
