True or false: Rice cultivation requires flooded conditions with the depth of water varying between 25 mm at the time of transplanting to 150 mm for 10 weeks of the growing period.,"##### Conditions for growing rice:  
Rice is a tropical crop which grows well where the average temperature during the growing season is between 20°C and 27°C. Abundant sunshine is also essential during its four months of growth. The minimum temperature should not go below 15°C as germination cannot take place below that temperature. Rice requires more water than any other crop. As a result, paddy cultivation is done only in those areas where minimum rainfall is 1,150 mm. Paddy also needs flooded conditions with the depth of water varying over 25 mm at the time of transplanting to as much as 150 mm for 10 weeks of the growing period.

What are the steps involved in the post-harvest processing of tea according to the provided context in Geography Form 2?,"#### Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation of tea:  
It takes two years for tea plants to be ready for harvesting. Picking of tea leaves requires experience because if it is done poorly, it may result in low-quality tea. Tea plants are normally plucked for 3-4 years after which all old branches are pruned for new shoots to grow. The plucked tea leaves undergo fermentation under regulated moisture to ensure quality tea product. Thereafter, tea leaves are rolled to enhance the breakup of the leaf cells and fibres. The leaves are then dried in temperatures of about 105°C. This process is called roasting or firing. Roasting stops fermentation and reduces moisture. Cool and dried tea is sorted in different sizes and graded. Unwanted particles are removed before packing. At this stage, tea is ready for consumption and export.

Over-exploitation of forest resources is one of the challenges. Forest resources are harvested to the point of reducing their ability to regenerate. For example, some forest tree species, especially natural trees, are usually in high demand. The demand compels over-harvesting of such forest resources so much so that they face extinction. In some cases, forests are harvested without following governing procedures and, consequently, some tree species may disappear. Experience indicates that ungoverned exploitation is usually serious in public-owned natural forests than in private planted forests.

True or False: Large-scale crop cultivation typically involves the use of simple tools such as hand-hoes and machetes for cultivation.,"#### Characteristics of large-scale crop cultivation:  
Large-scale crop cultivation is characterized by cultivation of a large area with the application of high level of technology. The technology involves the use of tractors, combine harvesters, and processing machines. As large-scale farming is highly mechanized, it employs few skilled people because machines carry out agricultural activities that otherwise could have been done manually by humans.  
In addition, such commercial farming is capital-intensive to support the production. Also, it is often based on a single crop, a practise known as monoculture. Chemical fertilisers are highly used to maximise yields. Large-scale agriculture is basically a source of raw materials for different manufacturing industries.

Explain how overgrazing can negatively impact the environment and the livelihood of nomadic pastoralists.,"#### Characteristics of nomadic pastoralism:  
The nomads normally move in groups. These groups are formed through the integration of families or members of a given ethnic group. A group involves a chief or elders who make decisions for the entire group. Indeed, large herd tends to cause overgrazing. Overgrazing is a situation where the number of cattle is greater than the carrying capacity of the grazing land. As a result, overgrazing causes soil erosion, land degradation, and loss of valuable species. Another feature of the nomadic pastoralists is the breeding process, which is uncontrolled. This situation may lead to the spread and outbreak of animal diseases, hence low animal quality and deaths.  
In addition, there is poor control of pests and other diseases, which result to poor quality of animal products. Furthermore, nomadic pastoralism takes place where the population is scarce as the animals are grazed in open range, which needs a lot of space.",tensor(0.4424),tensor(0.5410),tensor(0.4828),Explain what nomadic pastoralism means.,tensor(0.5608),tensor(0.4924),tensor(0.5156)

It takes two years for tea plants to be ready for harvesting. Picking of tea leaves requires experience because if it is done poorly, it may result in low-quality tea. Tea plants are normally plucked for 3-4 years after which all old branches are pruned for new shoots to grow. The plucked tea leaves undergo fermentation under regulated moisture to ensure quality tea product. Thereafter, tea leaves are rolled to enhance the breakup of the leaf cells and fibres. The leaves are then dried in temperatures of about 105°C. This process is called roasting or firing. Roasting stops fermentation and reduces moisture. Cool and dried tea is sorted in different sizes and graded. Unwanted particles are removed before packing. At this stage, tea is ready for consumption and export.

Nomadic pastoralism suffers from lack of processing and storage facilities, hence causing a significant loss of the products. Also, over-grazing under nomadic pastoralism leads to soil erosion. Moreover, the control of diseases is difficult since animals are always on the move, which can affect the health of the animals and lower productivity in the process. For example, there have been cases of loss of large numbers of livestock due to lack of water and pasture. This situation affects the economy of the pastoralists. Furthermore, the practise of nomadic pastoralism tends to cause conflicts as they interfere with crop cultivators’ land. Because of their nomadic nature, many of the pastoralists’ children fail to attend formal education.
