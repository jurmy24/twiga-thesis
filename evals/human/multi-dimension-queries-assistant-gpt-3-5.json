Traditional methods under nomadic pastoralism are actually cheap. Nomadic pastoralism is generally less costly compared to other forms of livestock management. It ensures the availability of food to the family and indigenous species of cattle are resistant to diseases. Additionally, the animals can tolerate walking long distances and withstand environmental hardships such as high temperatures, they can go for a long time without water, and they are cheap to manage in terms of shelter[0].",

It is primarily utilized for various purposes such as potable water supply, recreation, irrigation, industry, livestock, transportation, and hydroelectric energy. Over 63% of public water supply is withdrawn from surface water sources, while irrigation relies on surface water for 58% of its water supply. Industry gets almost 98% of its water from surface water systems. Additionally, small channels may also serve as water sources related to surface water. Hot springs release hot water, and geysers eject hot water and steam, adding to the variety of surface water sources and features [0].",

        "response": "**Detailed Explanation Question:**\n\nExplain the challenges facing large-scale agriculture in the USA as discussed in the Geography Form Two textbook.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nLarge-scale agriculture in the USA faces several challenges. Firstly, the high cost of production is a significant concern due to the highly mechanised nature of agriculture in the country. The use of automatic irrigation and agricultural machinery that rely on fossil fuels and other energy sources leads to increased production costs. Fluctuations in fossil fuel prices directly impact the overall cost of production. Additionally, the issue of water scarcity poses a challenge as irrigation demands a substantial amount of water. With the depletion of underground water sources outpacing replenishment, there is a growing shortage of water for agricultural purposes. \n\nAnother challenge is the loss of soil fertility resulting from over-cultivation and erosion. The soil erodes faster than it can naturally replenish itself, exacerbated by practices like over-irrigation that cause leaching of soil nutrients. Additionally, the high cost of land management is a common issue in large-scale agriculture, particularly due to the prevalence of monoculture. Monoculture depletes soil nutrients, necessitating constant application of fertilisers. Natural disasters such as droughts, hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes also pose severe challenges by damaging crops and hindering agricultural production. These disasters not only lead to low production but also affect transportation networks, impeding the movement of agricultural products from fields to storage and market centers[0].",
