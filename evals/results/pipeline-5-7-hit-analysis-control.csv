Need statement to say if true or not about Film Noir Characteristics,"#### Characteristics of large-scale crop cultivation:  
Large-scale crop cultivation is characterized by cultivation of a large area with the application of high level of technology. The technology involves the use of tractors, combine harvesters, and processing machines. As large-scale farming is highly mechanized, it employs few skilled people because machines carry out agricultural activities that otherwise could have been done manually by humans.  
In addition, such commercial farming is capital-intensive to support the production. Also, it is often based on a single crop, a practise known as monoculture. Chemical fertilisers are highly used to maximise yields. Large-scale agriculture is basically a source of raw materials for different manufacturing industries.

Please prepare a detailed explanation question for the topic Understanding Wine Terroir.,"Renewable energy sources: Renewable energy is any energy source that is naturally replaced. The energy can be derived from sunlight, tides, wind, water, geothermal, or hydroelectric action. Likewise, energy produced from the refining of various forms of biomass is often classified as renewable. The renewable energy sources are usually regarded as environmentally friendly because they release few chemicals that can harm the environment. These are energy resources that are naturally reused. Renewable sources are sustainable if they are carefully managed and maintained. They have minimal negative effects on the environment. Renewable energy sources include sunlight, geothermal heat, wind, tides, water, and various forms of biomass. Some of these energy sources are described in the following sub-sections.",0
Can you make a define question on Animal Behavioral Studies?,"Nomadic pastoralism involves continual movement of pastoralists with large numbers of animals from place to place in search of pasture and water. People involved in this practice are called nomads or pastoralists. Tribes which practise nomadic pastoralism include the Maasai, Barbaig, Kwavi, and Karamajong. Nomadic pastoralism is mostly practised in sparsely populated areas where the natural vegetation is mainly grass and bushes and, sometimes, scattered trees. In these areas, rainfall is very low and unreliable. The pastoralists follow specific routes in their movements. Figure 2.10 shows a large herd of cattle. The animals kept by pastoralists are a source of food and income through the selling of animals and their products. Major products from animals are meat and milk. The pastoralists spend the money they earn to meet family needs such as buying cereals, paying school fees, and meeting health expenses.

Semi-nomadism is a transition between total nomadism and sedentary animal keeping. It involves keeping a large number of animals especially cattle. Tribes which practice semi-nomadism include the Turkana of northern Kenya. The people involved in semi-nomadism usually travel away from their home for long periods during the dry season in search of pasture and water. This season is associated with scarcity of grass and water. Also, the semi-nomads’ movements contribute to the spread of diseases among their livestock. Semi-nomads usually cultivate crops during the rainy season to sustain their lives.",0

Sisal is a tropical plant whose leaves produce strong threads (fibres) which are used for various purposes such as rope and carpet making. Sisal was originally grown in southern Mexico. Subsequently, it has been widely cultivated in many other countries. In fact, it has widely been introduced in the tropics and subtropics. In Tanzania, sisal was introduced in 1893 by Dr Richard Hindorf and the first 62 sisal plants were planted near Pangani in Tanga Region. Until the 1960s, Tanzania was the leading producer of sisal, but since then Brazil has become the major world producer of sisal, followed by Tanzania, Kenya, Madagascar and China. In Tanzania, sisal is grown in Tanga, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Morogoro, Lindi and Mtwara regions.

Evapotranspiration refers to the process whereby water is transferred from the land to the air through plant roots and leaves. Water from the land is carried by roots to the leaves, a process known as transpiration, and then from the leaves it changes into vapour and moves into the atmosphere through the process of evaporation. The combination of these two processes form what is termed as evapotranspiration (Evaporation + transpiration = evapotranspiration). Evapotranspiration is determined by factors such as temperature, humidity, wind, soil, and type of plants. These factors are hereby explained.",0

Can you create a true-false statement for my students about the fundamentals of jazz music?,"#### Mining  
Mining is a process of extracting valuable geological substances from the crust of the earth. The extracted materials may be minerals, fossil fuels, and other geological materials. However, not all geological substances are categorized as minerals. In science, a mineral has specific characteristics such as being solid, inorganic, naturally occurring, has definite chemical composition and ordered internal structure. Although oil, coal and natural gas do not possess most of these characteristics, they may be categorized as minerals. From a non-scientific view, a mineral refers to a non-living naturally occurring resource from the earth. As such, oil, coal, and natural gas also qualify to be called mineral resources. Thus, petroleum and natural gas which are discussed as case studies in this chapter are treated as minerals. Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water.",0
