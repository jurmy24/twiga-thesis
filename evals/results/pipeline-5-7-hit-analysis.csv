"morning plz, need a long answer question on how subsistence farming benefits my students","#### Small-scale crop cultivation:  
Small-scale crop cultivation is the growing of crops on a small piece of land. It is also called subsistence farming. It aims to produce enough food for the wellbeing of families. In some instances, when the production is high, the surplus is sold. Individuals engaging in small-scale crop cultivation are known as peasants. They are also called subsistence farmers as they grow food crops to feed themselves and their families with little or no surplus for sale.  
As noted earlier, the agricultural system at subsistence level falls under this category. A farmer owns a small piece of land for food crops cultivation. The produce is enough only for the family. It is hand to mouth existence which may lead to famine if the harvest is bad. In years with good harvest the farmer may have surplus to sell to the local markets. The farms are small, about one to five hectares owned by the family. Application of machines is difficult as farms are small.",1

There are several challenges facing large-scale agriculture in the USA. Some of them are high cost of production as agriculture in the USA is highly mechanised. Automatic irrigation and agricultural machinery require fossil fuels and other sources of energy to run them. The increase in the price of fossil fuel, therefore, increases the cost of production. At times, there is a shortage of water as irrigation requires a lot of water.

please I need a short answer question on post-harvest processing of tea for my students to answer in geography form 2,"#### Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation of tea:  
It takes two years for tea plants to be ready for harvesting. Picking of tea leaves requires experience because if it is done poorly, it may result in low-quality tea. Tea plants are normally plucked for 3-4 years after which all old branches are pruned for new shoots to grow. The plucked tea leaves undergo fermentation under regulated moisture to ensure quality tea product. Thereafter, tea leaves are rolled to enhance the breakup of the leaf cells and fibres. The leaves are then dried in temperatures of about 105°C. This process is called roasting or firing. Roasting stops fermentation and reduces moisture. Cool and dried tea is sorted in different sizes and graded. Unwanted particles are removed before packing. At this stage, tea is ready for consumption and export.

Please provide a true-false statement concerning the characteristics of commercial farming that my students can answer.,"#### Characteristics of large-scale crop cultivation:  
Large-scale crop cultivation is characterized by cultivation of a large area with the application of high level of technology. The technology involves the use of tractors, combine harvesters, and processing machines. As large-scale farming is highly mechanized, it employs few skilled people because machines carry out agricultural activities that otherwise could have been done manually by humans.  
In addition, such commercial farming is capital-intensive to support the production. Also, it is often based on a single crop, a practise known as monoculture. Chemical fertilisers are highly used to maximise yields. Large-scale agriculture is basically a source of raw materials for different manufacturing industries.

I need a define question for soil absorption,"(b) Reclamation of land affected by soil erosion differs from land covered by water. Soil affected by erosion calls for planting of trees. Trees will act as binding agents for keeping the soil particles together and absorbing excess water which would otherwise flow rapidly over the land. Moreover, using better methods of agriculture such as contour ploughing, terracing, and strip farming especially in steep slopes helps to prevent erosion.  
(c) Land may also be reclaimed by restoring its fertility. In this case, land which has lost fertility may require planting cover crops and addition of organic manure and fertilisers to improve its fertility. The fertility will attract vegetation growth. Vegetation will not only bind the soil but also protect it from excessive loss of water through transpiration.  
(d) Land affected by excessive animal keeping can be restored by reducing the number of animals in the area. This simple reclamation method allows the land to be proportionally used.",0

"hello, can you help me create a discussion question for students to explain the characteristics of nomadic pastoralism.","#### Characteristics of nomadic pastoralism:  
The nomads normally move in groups. These groups are formed through the integration of families or members of a given ethnic group. A group involves a chief or elders who make decisions for the entire group. Indeed, large herd tends to cause overgrazing. Overgrazing is a situation where the number of cattle is greater than the carrying capacity of the grazing land. As a result, overgrazing causes soil erosion, land degradation, and loss of valuable species. Another feature of the nomadic pastoralists is the breeding process, which is uncontrolled. This situation may lead to the spread and outbreak of animal diseases, hence low animal quality and deaths.  
In addition, there is poor control of pests and other diseases, which result to poor quality of animal products. Furthermore, nomadic pastoralism takes place where the population is scarce as the animals are grazed in open range, which needs a lot of space.",1

Request a long-answer exercise on Post-harvest processing of tea.,"#### Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation of tea:  
It takes two years for tea plants to be ready for harvesting. Picking of tea leaves requires experience because if it is done poorly, it may result in low-quality tea. Tea plants are normally plucked for 3-4 years after which all old branches are pruned for new shoots to grow. The plucked tea leaves undergo fermentation under regulated moisture to ensure quality tea product. Thereafter, tea leaves are rolled to enhance the breakup of the leaf cells and fibres. The leaves are then dried in temperatures of about 105°C. This process is called roasting or firing. Roasting stops fermentation and reduces moisture. Cool and dried tea is sorted in different sizes and graded. Unwanted particles are removed before packing. At this stage, tea is ready for consumption and export.

Please have a simple definition question ready about mitigating negative tourism impacts for my form 2 class,"#### Negative impact of tourism:  
The negative impact of tourism includes the following:  
Tourism has sometimes led to cultural interference and conflicts. Sometimes tourists bring with them practices that are unacceptable to the people in the host country, for example, ways of dressing, food style, and language. Moral decay has occurred in places that are visited by tourists. For example, cases of prostitution, same-sex relationships (homosexuality), and drug abuse have become common in areas with tourist attractions such as beaches and nightclubs.  
In addition, tourist activities in national parks and other protected areas may lead to environmental degradation such as off road driving and dumping of waste such as paper and plastics.  
Moreover, the continued presence of people and vehicles in the tourists sites may lead to change in animal behaviours.",1

The textile industry provides employment opportunities to both skilled and unskilled labourers. Skilled labour is required in the textile industry for designing, spinning, cotton weaving, bleaching, dyeing, and printing of cotton fabrics. Unskilled labour is equally needed to support skilled workers, for example, by clearing and providing security.  
The textile industry also stimulates production in other sectors of the economy such as agriculture, transportation, commerce, and trade. The industry operates because raw materials are readily available. In Tanzania, cotton is the main raw material for the textile industry. Farmers will continue to produce cotton when they are assured of ready markets for their cotton.",1
I need a defining question about soil absorption for my form 2 geography class,"(b) Reclamation of land affected by soil erosion differs from land covered by water. Soil affected by erosion calls for planting of trees. Trees will act as binding agents for keeping the soil particles together and absorbing excess water which would otherwise flow rapidly over the land. Moreover, using better methods of agriculture such as contour ploughing, terracing, and strip farming especially in steep slopes helps to prevent erosion.  
(c) Land may also be reclaimed by restoring its fertility. In this case, land which has lost fertility may require planting cover crops and addition of organic manure and fertilisers to improve its fertility. The fertility will attract vegetation growth. Vegetation will not only bind the soil but also protect it from excessive loss of water through transpiration.  
(d) Land affected by excessive animal keeping can be restored by reducing the number of animals in the area. This simple reclamation method allows the land to be proportionally used.",0

With rising global demand, highly volatile prices are increasingly becoming stringent. The oil and gas industry faces three major challenges involving how to reduce costs, optimize the performance of its industrial base assets, and address its environmental footprint. Environmental pollution is one of these challenges. Oil refinery and production of petroleum products produce carbon dioxide and other gases such as methane which are harmful. As countries in the Middle East have large oil production industries, the emission of harmful gases is also high. These gases contribute to the pollution of water, air, and land. Burning fossil fuels produces sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. When they move into the atmosphere they produce acid rain, which damages buildings and vegetation in addition to affecting fish and other organisms that live in water.

I need a describe question for my students on the topic of benefits of subsistence farming in Tanzania,"Some of the challenges facing large-scale crop cultivation in Tanzania are high cost of production. Large-scale farming requires a large capital investment to buy machinery and farm inputs, prepare land and pay farm labourers. It also relies on seasonal rainfall. Climatic changes have largely affected the amount of rainfall in many areas of Tanzania. Since the majority of large-scale farmers in Tanzania rely on rain-fed agriculture, whenever there is a shortage of rainfall, agricultural production falls. Agricultural products from large-scale crop cultivation in Tanzania such as tea, sisal and coffee face stiff competition from other countries that produce the same crops. As a result, prices of such products tend to be low. In addition, large-scale crop cultivation in Tanzania has to contend with pests and diseases.
