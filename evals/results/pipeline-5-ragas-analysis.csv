0,Please provide a statement on global timber industry that is either true or false for my secondary students.,True or False: The USA is the leading country in timber production worldwide.,"['### Timber production in the world  \nTimber production is a process of growing, harvesting, and regenerating trees for industrial or domestic use. Worldwide, USA is leading in timber production with 481,092,992 cubic metres. In Africa, Ethiopia is a leading country with 91,283,543 cubic metres. There are ten leading timber-producing countries in the world as listed in Table 4.1. Tanzania is one of the countries that produce timber. The major timber producing regions of Tanzania are Tabora, Ruvuma, Coast, Njombe, Morogoro, Kilimanjaro, Kigoma, Kagera, Iringa, Lindi, and Arusha.'
 'Source of energy: Forests provide firewood and charcoal which are used as sources of energy in the households. Wood energy provides 9% of the global primary energy supply, making it the most important source of bioenergy in the world. In some parts of Africa, fuel wood is the most affordable source of energy and it accounts for about 90% of primary energy consumption.  \nEmployment: Individuals are employed in the forestry sector as forest officers and forest guards. Others are employed as lumberers while some are self-employed in carpentry and joinery, and others are timber merchants who buy and sell timber. Forest industries provide formal employment to 0.4% of the global labour force, contributing to nearly 1% of global GDP in 2008.'
 '### Challenges facing timber transportation in the world  \nTimber is useful for the achievement of social and economic development of various countries. However, transportation of timber faces a number of challenges.'
 'which are the main constituents of forests. Estimates indicate that each year fires burn 6-14 million hectares of forests around the world. Construction of different infrastructure for social and economic support is a challenge to the forestry industry. Different construction activities lead to the devastation of forests. For example, the construction of dams, roads and railway lines forces the clearing of some forest hectares. In addition, population increase presents another challenge to the forestry industry. As the population increases, more space for human settlement and life support is required. As a result, people tend to invade the forests and clear them for settlements, farming, charcoal burning and firewood fetching. Then there is the challenge of global warming. Global warming results from the accumulation of harmful gases in the atmosphere. In this case, the gases destroy the ozone layer and makes some trees in the forest wither and dry after failing to withstand the'
 'Fuelwood comprises unprocessed wood biomass harvested from stems, branches or other parts of trees. Likewise, sometimes it is generated from wood residues such as sawdust and wood shavings generated from timber harvesting, or wood processing industries. Globally, roughly 2500 million people rely on wood fuel for heating and cooking. In USA, the community uses about 85% of all the wood collected from forests as fuel or charcoal for heating and cooking.  \nIn Tanzania, biomass/bio-power (wood) is the largest energy source. More than 1 million people engage in charcoal production and supply. Currently, there is an upsurge in modern biomass utilization. The raw materials available such as municipal solid waste, forest residues, sugar bagasse, rice husk, sisal, and coffee can be used to generate power.'

1,Please I need a short question to ask my students about obstacles in river basin projects,What are two obstacles facing river basin projects according to the context provided?,"['#### Requirements for establishing a river basin project  \nAs river basin projects serve social and economic purposes, they need to be carefully designed by observing a number of issues. The following are some of the requirements which should be observed when establishing a river basin project:  \n- Construction of dams for retaining water.\n- Removal of silt or mud from the river or dam (dredging).\n- For transport purposes, the river channels should be straightened and widened so that they can accommodate more water.\n- Trees should be planted on marginal land, hill slopes, and riverbanks. This will help to control soil erosion and check the movement of surface run-off, to reduce or prevent silting and flooding.  \nIf such requirements are observed, river basin projects will achieve the expected benefits.'
 'River basin development also attracts irrigation. Due to the availability of water in a basin, commercial agriculture is established through irrigation schemes. Sometimes, individual peasants use a well-managed river basin for watering their small farms using traditional mechanisms such as buckets. In addition, river basin development projects involve planting of trees and construction of dams. They also involve strict measures for prohibiting deforestation and poor cultivation practises. All these measures aim to foster appropriate use of the land to keep it productive. These measures also enable the preservation of the ecosystem. By doing so, these projects contribute to preventing the land from being eroded by environmental problems such as soil erosion, floods and loss of soil fertility.'
 '#### Challenges facing river basin projects  \nRiver basin projects face numerous challenges. Many of these challenges are caused by natural events and human activitiesthattakeplaceinthebasins. These are described below.  \n##### Siltation  \nSiltation is one of the challenges facing river basin projects. The water in dams depends on the supply of water from highland areas through streams and rivers. Usually streams flowing into dams carry some sediments which ultimately accumulate in the dams. This accumulation of sediments leads to a decrease in the volume of water which may have numerous impacts. These impacts may include lowering the ability of dams to produce enough water necessary for electricity generation, in addition to affecting transport and destroying marine organisms.  \n##### Water pollution'
 '#### Benefits of river basin development projects  \nThe benefits of a river basin project vary depending on the nature and scale of the project, location, and administrative structure. The lower section of rivers is usually exposed to excessive rainwater, causing floods. To prevent floods, basin management establishes dams which serve as collection areas of excessive water. River basins in their natural state may hardly be safe for human settlement. In fact, the establishment of basin development projects increases the value of the basins and makes them more conducive for human settlement. This compels governments to extend social services such as infrastructure, health, and education.'
 '#### Other river basin development projects  \nThere are various river basin development projects in Africa under different authorities. In Tanzania, the river basins include Rufiji River Basin in which the Stiegler’s Gorge project (Nyerere Hydroelectric Power Plant) for generation of hydroelectric power is located, and Kagera River Basin which is jointly managed by Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi. Other river basin development projects in Africa include the Gezira Irrigation Scheme (Sudan), Aswan High Dam (Egypt) and Galole Irrigation Scheme (Kenya). Others are the Volta River Project (Ghana), Orange River Project (South Africa), Cabora Bassa Basin (Mozambique) and Tana River Development Project in Kenya. Outside Africa, river basin development projects include the Ganges Project (India), Amazon Basin Development Scheme (Brazil), and Tennessee River Basin Project in USA.  \n##### The Tennessee Valley Authority'

2,Please prepare a true or false statement about rice cultivation for the upcoming geography test.,True or false: Rice cultivation requires flooded conditions with the depth of water varying between 25 mm at the time of transplanting to 150 mm for 10 weeks of the growing period.,"['##### Conditions for growing rice:  \nRice is a tropical crop which grows well where the average temperature during the growing season is between 20°C and 27°C. Abundant sunshine is also essential during its four months of growth. The minimum temperature should not go below 15°C as germination cannot take place below that temperature. Rice requires more water than any other crop. As a result, paddy cultivation is done only in those areas where minimum rainfall is 1,150 mm. Paddy also needs flooded conditions with the depth of water varying over 25 mm at the time of transplanting to as much as 150 mm for 10 weeks of the growing period.  \n##### Farm preparation, planting and care of rice:'
 '#### Rice  \nRice is an edible seed from one of the grass species. As a cereal crop, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world’s human population, especially in Asia. It is an agricultural commodity with the third- highest worldwide production. Rice is grown in most regions of Tanzania including Coast, Morogoro, Tabora, Mbeya, Mwanza, Shinyanga, Simiyu, and Geita. Globally, it is grown in China, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Thailand, Japan and Kenya.  \n##### Conditions for growing rice:'
 'Planting work begins with land preparation as well as the nursery bed for obtaining the seedlings. The seedlings should be planted as young as possible, usually at 20 days. Seeds are planted by removing them from the nursery to the paddy fields. Good rice planting should use the pull to the right and to the left with a distance of 20 cm x 20 cm. This is to enable maintenance, either weeding or fertilising in addition to allowing each plant to receive enough sunlight and nutrients evenly. Seedlings are planted with just one seed in one planting hole. Farmers are required to maintain water and water discharge on paddy fields and weeding (weed control). Irrigating rice crops in rice fields should consider the depth of water in accordance with the age of the plant. Weeds are herbs that live with cultivated plants and are generally very harmful to rice crops. As such, weeding is very important. Fertilisation is done to add nutrients needed by plants in the soil.

3,"Hello, I need a true or false statement question for my students about challenges in Tanzania's textile industry.",True or False: The challenges facing Tanzania's textile industries include the use of advanced technology in their operations.,"['#### Challenges facing textile industries in Tanzania:  \nMany of the textile industries have been operating for a long time in such a way that their machines have become out of date. With the advancement of technology, the old machines in textile industries need to be replaced by new ones for efficiency purposes. There is also a lack of adequate skilled labour, leading to the need to import labour from outside the country, resulting in increased production costs. Lack of adequate capital and inadequate supply of raw materials limit the ability of the industries to increase productivity.  \nPoor transport and communication systems also hinder timely transportation of raw materials to industries and manufactured goods to the markets. High costs and unreliable power supply constitute other challenges because they reduce profit from industrial production. The chemicals used in textile industries are also expensive, leading to reduced profit from textile industries.'
 '#### Importance of textile industries in Tanzania:  \nThe textile industry provides employment opportunities to both skilled and unskilled labourers. Skilled labour is required in the textile industry for designing, spinning, cotton weaving, bleaching, dyeing, and printing of cotton fabrics. Unskilled labour is equally needed to support skilled workers, for example, by clearing and providing security.  \nThe textile industry also stimulates production in other sectors of the economy such as agriculture, transportation, commerce, and trade. The industry operates because raw materials are readily available. In Tanzania, cotton is the main raw material for the textile industry. Farmers will continue to produce cotton when they are assured of ready markets for their cotton.'
 '### Textile industries in Tanzania  \nTextile industries deal with the manufacturing of clothes from cotton, wool, silk, nylon, rayon or linen as raw materials.

In Tanzania, there are varieties of attractive sceneries including Mount Kilimanjaro, Ngorongoro Crater, Great Rift Valley and Amboni Caves. These landmarks contribute much to the development of tourism in the country. Others are Oldonyo Lengai and Mount Meru.'
 'Increase in population for settlement and agriculture expansion has led to encroachment on national parks and game reserves. This has led to degradation of wildlife areas, threatening their existence. In addition, crime and violent activities in some areas will discourage tourists from visiting such areas.  \n##### Promoting tourism in Tanzania:  \nThe following are the ways that can be used to promote tourism in Tanzania:  \n- Marketing strategies and publicity: Marketing of the tourism sector both domestically and internationally should be enhanced. There is a need for the government and other players in the industry to market aggressively the country’s tourist attractions in international media and forums.'
 '#### Challenges facing tourism in Tanzania:  \nThe tourism industry in Tanzania is faced with problems of transport and communication, which are not that well-developed, hence limiting tourist movement. For example, some of the roads are rough and, therefore, it is impossible to use them during the rainy season. Internet services are also expensive and not reliable. The country also faces a problem of poor co-ordination between the government and other players in the industry. In addition, there is a shortage of funds for the development of the tourism industry. Moreover, Tanzania does not have adequate and sustainable marketing strategies to advertise and promote the unique attraction sites available in the country.'
 '- Marketing: The Government of Tanzania as well as private players in the tourism industry should invest in marketing the country’s tourism attractions all over the world. By doing so, the number of tourists will increase, thus contributing to the national economy.\n- Strong tourism policy: The government should formulate and enforce a strong tourism policy that is geared towards promoting culture-based tourism and eco-tourism.\n- Package tours: The government should promote package tours that allow for tour arrangements, including hotel reservations and travels to be done by a company. This will increase the number of tourists visiting the country.\n- Regional co-operation: Tanzania, as a member of Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), has to fully utilise opportunities aimed to promote the tourism industry especially through the use of the Regional Tourism Organisation of the Southern Africa Countries (RETOSA).'
 'The improvement of transport and communication contributes to easy movement of tourists from one place to another. Tanzania is investing in improving airline transport to strengthen the tourism industry.  \nIn addition, Tanzania has adequate and comfortable accommodation to cater for tourists with different economic status, hence attracting a large number of tourists.

By 2013, the annual power demand increase was between 10 percent and 15 percent. The demand for power and energy is expected to increase because of the new industries that are to be constructed.  \nFunds allocation for exploration: The government is required to allocate adequate funds for exploring other sources of power. Tanzania is endowed with many power and energy sources, which have not been yet harnessed due to lack of capital.  \nTraining of skilled personnel: More young Tanzanians should be trained on HEP and biogas exploration and production.'
 '### Challenges to harnessing power and energy in Tanzania:  \nPower and energy harnessing in Tanzania faces various challenges ranging from naturally occurring to human-made ones. The following are some of the challenges facing power and energy harnessing in Tanzania.  \nFluctuation of river volume: In the dry season, rain may be scarce or completely absent which reduces water in dams and, consequently, lowers the generation of HEP. Tanzania has been experiencing periods of power-cut particularly during the dry season because of over-dependence on HEP.'
 '## Chapter Eight (Sustainable use of power and energy resources)  \n### Introduction  \nPower and energy are important for every aspect of human life.

7,I need a define question for the obstacles in energy production for the students form 2,What are two obstacles in energy production that may hinder the harnessing of solar and wind energy potential in the USA?,"['#### Addressing challenges facing solar and wind energy in USA:  \nThe challenges facing solar and wind energy production may hinder the expected harnessing of this potential energy if deliberate efforts are not made to address them.  \nInstallation of wind turbines and solar panels: Solar and wind energy depends very much on the number and quality of wind turbines and solar panels. The higher the quality of gadgets available, the more the amount of energy produced. It is, therefore, advisable to install enough wind turbines and solar panels over a wide area to increase the amount of energy harnessed.  \nResearch: Research on solar and wind energy is likely to find some solutions to many challenges facing the production of energy from wind and the sun. Research may involve studying the behaviour of wind and new technologies for tapping solar energy day and night.'
 'Renewable and non-renewable energy: Renewable energy is energy generated from sources that are essentially inexhaustible. Examples of renewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, geothermal energy, tidal power, and hydroelectric power. Non-renewable energy includes conventional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which are likely to get depleted with use.  \nConventional and non-conventional energy: Conventional energy is an energy source which is fixed in nature like oil, gas, coal, and hydropower generation. It is also termed as non-renewable energy or thermal energy. The conventional energy resources are being used extensively; as a result, their known reserves have been depleted to a great extent. The use of conventional energy has emerging effects on the environment. The non-conventional energy involves energy generated by wind, tides, solar and biomass. These are renewable sources of energy and not exhaustible.'
 'Renewable energy sources: Renewable energy is any energy source that is naturally replaced. The energy can be derived from sunlight, tides, wind, water, geothermal, or hydroelectric action. Likewise, energy produced from the refining of various forms of biomass is often classified as renewable. The renewable energy sources are usually regarded as environmentally friendly because they release few chemicals that can harm the environment. These are energy resources that are naturally reused. Renewable sources are sustainable if they are carefully managed and maintained. They have minimal negative effects on the environment. Renewable energy sources include sunlight, geothermal heat, wind, tides, water, and various forms of biomass. Some of these energy sources are described in the following sub-sections.'
 '### The concept of Power and Energy  \nPower: Power is the flow of energy at any one time, and can be generated from renewable energy resources through solar conversion (solar, thermal electricity, solar heating); harnessing water (hydropower for electricity, wave and tidal generation through turbines); harnessing the wind (wind pumps for water, wind turbines for electricity); and a variety of other energy sources. The main power sources are petroleum (oil), natural gas, water, coal and nuclear. Other sources include the earth’s interior (hot springs), wind, sun, tides, and waves, wood, peat and cattle or cow dung (biogas).'
 'Industrial development: In USA, solar and wind energy have been found to be feasible sources of alternative energy for industrial development. The energy generated is considered cheaper than other available sources of energy such as fossil energy, HEP, natural gas, and nuclear energy.  \nExpansion of agriculture: Large-scale agriculture has been made possible by the availability of electricity from this source. The power is used in irrigation and processing of agricultural products.  \nAffordability: Solar and wind energy are relatively cheaper for many people in USA especially those who are unable to use other sources of electricity because it is subsidized by the government. This has improved their living standards.'

Specifically, natural gas is produced at Songosongo, Mnazi Bay, Msimbati, Kiliwani North, and Ntorya. Furthermore, exploration of natural gas and petroleum is going on in Tanzania and there are signs of their availability in other coastal regions and islands of Tanzania. In recent years, the exploration has indicated the availability of petroleum and natural gas in Pemba – Zanzibar.  \nThe major producers of petroleum and natural gas in the world include USA, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Russia, Nigeria, Gabon, Libya, Kuwait, Algeria, Angola, Venezuela, Mexico, and Egypt.'
 '#### Challenges of natural gas production in Tanzania:  \nNatural gas production faces numerous challenges in different aspects. Natural gas is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, care has to be when extracting this resource. Natural gas production is new in Tanzania and, thus, it faces a shortage of skilled labour, especially in exploration and extraction activities. As a result, the government is often forced to employ foreign experts who are paid high salaries. Regarding the capacity to produce the natural gas, Tanzania has not been able to allocate enough funds for exploration, extraction, processing and distribution.'
 '#### Tanzania’s efforts in addressing the challenges of natural gas production  \nTanzania has been trying to overcome the challenges associated with the production of its natural gas. The government has been emphasising the use of revenue from natural gas to benefit the people in the areas producing the gas and the nation as a whole. The revenue from natural gas is used to improve social services in education and health. There have been various public programmes aimed to educate the public on natural gas benefits. The ministries responsible for energy and mineral resources in Tanzania conduct awareness creation programmes through various ways such as meetings and the media. The government also provides opportunities for training to Tanzanians in oil and natural gas. These training opportunities aim to build the country’s capacity for exploration, extraction, processing and supplying of natural gas.'
 'Tanzania benefits a lot from its natural gas resources. The resources benefit the economy of the country but also improve the lives of its people. Natural gas has contributed to the improvement of infrastructure. Transport and communication systems to and from source of natural gas areas have been improved. For example, the discovery and extraction of gas in Mtwara Region has stimulated improvement of the airport and the harbour in the region. As a result, air transport to and from Mtwara Region has also improved. Natural gas has also created the demand for labour, goods and services. There has been an increase in the demand for both skilled and unskilled labour to work in the mines and carry out mining-related activities.

This board is also responsible for training people engaged in the tourism industry. For example, the NTB has established offices abroad to market and promote tourism in Namibia. These offices are in different parts of the world such as Johannesburg, Cape Town, Germany, New York, England and Spain. As a result, this aggressive promotion increases the number of tourists in the country.'
 '#### Strong tourism policy:  \nNamibia’s national tourism policy aims to provide a framework for mobilising tourism resources to realise long-term national goals as defined in the country’s Vision 2030. The policy ensures that tourism is developed in a sustainable, equitable and responsible manner. The policy also insists on eco-tourism as an integrated approach which involves carrying out tourist activities with minimum negative impact on the natural environment.

They may be generated from waves, winds, waterfalls, solar, natural gases, geothermo, oil and coal. In this chapter, you will learn about the major sources of power, the methods of acquiring and extracting power and energy, and the uses of power and energy resources. You will also learn about the problems facing power and energy production, specifically solar and wind power production in the USA, hydroelectric and biogas production in Tanzania. Finally, you will learn about problems related to power and energy extraction in the USA and Tanzania.'
 '### Importance of power and energy  \nThe following section explains why power and energy are important to human life.  \nRunning machines: Power and energy are used to run machines in industries and provide light at homes, schools, hospitals and other institutions. In the agricultural sector, energy is used to run farm machinery and equipment such as tractors and combine harvesters.  \nRaw materials: Some sources of energy are raw materials of some industries. For example, oil is a raw material for petrochemical and refinery industries in the making of plastics, medicines, clothes, and ropes.  \nTransport enhancement: Energy plays an important role in improving the transport sector because vehicles, locomotives, aircraft, and vessels use petrol or diesel.'
 '### The concept of Power and Energy  \nPower: Power is the flow of energy at any one time, and can be generated from renewable energy resources through solar conversion (solar, thermal electricity, solar heating); harnessing water (hydropower for electricity, wave and tidal generation through turbines); harnessing the wind (wind pumps for water, wind turbines for electricity); and a variety of other energy sources. The main power sources are petroleum (oil), natural gas, water, coal and nuclear. Other sources include the earth’s interior (hot springs), wind, sun, tides, and waves, wood, peat and cattle or cow dung (biogas).'
 'Renewable and non-renewable energy: Renewable energy is energy generated from sources that are essentially inexhaustible. Examples of renewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, geothermal energy, tidal power, and hydroelectric power. Non-renewable energy includes conventional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which are likely to get depleted with use.  \nConventional and non-conventional energy: Conventional energy is an energy source which is fixed in nature like oil, gas, coal, and hydropower generation. It is also termed as non-renewable energy or thermal energy. The conventional energy resources are being used extensively; as a result, their known reserves have been depleted to a great extent. The use of conventional energy has emerging effects on the environment. The non-conventional energy involves energy generated by wind, tides, solar and biomass. These are renewable sources of energy and not exhaustible.'
 'Power is found within our bodies, machines, in plants and bodies of animals, insects and birds. Power is also inherently present in natural forces like wind, tides, waves, and water whose movements can be utilized to drive machines, or generate electricity. In our daily lives, power is needed to cook food, to drive machinery in industrial plants, to provide light and heat, and to propel vehicles of different types.  \nEnergy: Energy can be defined as the capacity for, or equivalent of, doing work. Energy is the ability to work so as to produce motion. For example, when water turns a turbine, electricity is produced. Also energy is used to drive machines and provide heat and light.  \nThe society requires energy for transportation, heating and cooling of buildings, powering production processes in industry, and various household needs. Energy can be grouped into various types as explained below.'
 'Briefly, explain four uses of power and energy from different sources.'

12,"Hello my friend, please help with a describing question for enhacement methods of subsistence farming",Describe two ways in which small-scale crop cultivation can be improved to be more intensive and productive.,"['#### Small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop cultivation is the growing of crops on a small piece of land. It is also called subsistence farming. It aims to produce enough food for the wellbeing of families. In some instances, when the production is high, the surplus is sold. Individuals engaging in small-scale crop cultivation are known as peasants. They are also called subsistence farmers as they grow food crops to feed themselves and their families with little or no surplus for sale.  \nAs noted earlier, the agricultural system at subsistence level falls under this category. A farmer owns a small piece of land for food crops cultivation. The produce is enough only for the family. It is hand to mouth existence which may lead to famine if the harvest is bad. In years with good harvest the farmer may have surplus to sell to the local markets. The farms are small, about one to five hectares owned by the family. Application of machines is difficult as farms are small.'
 'The resulting population growth affects land use patterns. This may cause shortage of food and poor living standards. The solution to this problem is to improve small-scale crop cultivation. The government and other organisations should help farmers by providing them with education and capital to make subsistence agriculture more intensive and more productive. Moreover, the government, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and co-operative societies should help the farmers to select better seeds, use proper insecticides, pesticides, and apply fertilisers properly. In addition, they should help in providing transport to make sure the products reach proper storage places and markets. Furthermore, the government should emphasise and support the opening of joint agriculture ventures, finding of markets for surplus products and establishing good storage facilities. Additionally, deliberate efforts should be made to provide education on good farming practises, for example, the use of simple'
 'Livestock-keeping is categorized into traditional or subsistence and modern or commercial livestock-keeping. Categories of traditional livestock-keeping are nomadic, semi-nomadic, transhumance, and sedentary. Traditional or subsistence livestock-keeping is practised in arid areas that receive less rainfall per annum. These places do not support crop production. Ethnic groups that engage in traditional livestock-keeping are the Maasai, Sukuma, and Barbaig of Tanzania. In Uganda, it is mostly practised by the Karamajong. In Kenya, it is practised by the Maasai, the Turkana, and the Samburu.'
 'Agriculture can be done by individual farmers, companies, or co-operative societies. Crop farming is the type of agriculture that involves the cultivation of land to produce crops. Crop farming can be practised to produce food crops and cash crops.  \nFood crops include rice, beans, cassava, maize, wheat, bananas, and potatoes whereas cash crops include sisal, coffee, tea, and cashew-nuts. Figure 1.1 shows a rice paddy.  \nFigure 1.1 Rice paddy  \nSource: Mwakalinga 03 June 2016: ippmedia.com'

 '#### Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation of tea:  \nIt takes two years for tea plants to be ready for harvesting. Picking of tea leaves requires experience because if it is done poorly, it may result in low-quality tea. Tea plants are normally plucked for 3-4 years after which all old branches are pruned for new shoots to grow. The plucked tea leaves undergo fermentation under regulated moisture to ensure quality tea product. Thereafter, tea leaves are rolled to enhance the breakup of the leaf cells and fibres. The leaves are then dried in temperatures of about 105°C. This process is called roasting or firing. Roasting stops fermentation and reduces moisture. Cool and dried tea is sorted in different sizes and graded. Unwanted particles are removed before packing. At this stage, tea is ready for consumption and export.

14,I need a true or false question for my students about soil absorption.,True or False: Vegetation growth on fertile soil increases evapotranspiration.,"['#### Soil:  \nThe type of soil also determines the amount of water that can be retained in the soil and the amount of water that can be drawn from the soil through transpiration or evaporation. Fertile soil tends to support the growth of vegetation which increases the rate of evapotranspiration. Soil, which supports vegetation, allows much evapotranspiration to take place.'
 '(b) Reclamation of land affected by soil erosion differs from land covered by water. Soil affected by erosion calls for planting of trees. Trees will act as binding agents for keeping the soil particles together and absorbing excess water which would otherwise flow rapidly over the land. Moreover, using better methods of agriculture such as contour ploughing, terracing, and strip farming especially in steep slopes helps to prevent erosion.  \n(c) Land may also be reclaimed by restoring its fertility. In this case, land which has lost fertility may require planting cover crops and addition of organic manure and fertilisers to improve its fertility. The fertility will attract vegetation growth. Vegetation will not only bind the soil but also protect it from excessive loss of water through transpiration.  \n(d) Land affected by excessive animal keeping can be restored by reducing the number of animals in the area. This simple reclamation method allows the land to be proportionally used.'
 'During photosynthesis, oxygen is released by plants into the environment through the stomata, and this is used by animals. At the same time animals release carbon dioxide that is absorbed by the plants. By doing so, a balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide in the environment is maintained. Forests provide suitable habitats for wildlife and, therefore, contribute to the balance of ecosystem. Various animals live in the forest which gives them shelter and food as they eat leaves, roots and fruits. Moreover, forests help to control soil erosion as they protect the soil from being eroded by blowing wind and running water. Trees in the forest bind together the soil particles using roots, and reduce the impact of raindrops with the same roots. Plant leaves reduce the impact of rain drops on the soil and reduce excessive evaporation of soil water.'
 '#### Infiltration:  \nInfiltration, which is sometimes called percolation, is the process whereby water that has reached the ground penetrates into the soil or rocks (Figure 3.6).  \nSome of the water may seep through and go deep underground and create underground runoff or aquifer in the rocks. Water that percolates the land surface is called underground water. Infiltration is an essential process as it feeds water bodies and soils which are sources of evaporation and evapotranspiration.'

Overall, the development of the livestock-keeping sector is important in both countries. Moreover, the two countries practise livestock at both the subsistence and commercial levels. The animals and their products can be used to meet family needs and sometimes be sold to raise revenue. In Tanzania, sedentary livestock-keeping is practised in densely populated areas and, hence, with a shortage of land such as the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro and the Southern Highlands whereas in Australia it is practised specifically in the South East of the country.'
 '#### Livestock-keeping in Australia  \nAustralia is made up of mainland Australia, the island of Tasmania and numerous isles Livestock industries have played a fundamental role in the development of Australia over the past 200 years, first as an essential source of food and later as the principal source of exports which triggered the economic growth of the nation and supported the development of its land and water resources. The livestock export industry supports the livelihood of many people in both rural and urban areas. The sector contributes to about 45% of the gross value of annual production of Australia’s agricultural sector.'
 'Livestock farming businesses provide direct employment for the Australian people. The livestock and livestock processing industries also generate about $11.2 billion in export revenue annually. In fact, the value of these exports has increased steadily over recent years generating foreign currency.'
 'Livestock-keeping in Tanzania, on the contrary, is mainly for meeting domestic demands with some few animals and animal products being exported, but on a lower scale than in Australia. In Tanzania, sheep and goats are kept for meat and skins. Moreover, the application of science and technology in livestock-keeping is much more advanced in Australia than it is in Tanzania. The main rearing system of livestock-keeping in Tanzania is pastoralism and zero-grazing, whereas in Australia it is primarily the ranching system. In addition, Australia has many industries for processing animal products, whereas in Tanzania efforts are underway to establish such industries on a commercial scale.'

The Tanzania Wildlife Authority (TAWA) is responsible for the management and regulation of the use of all the areas designated as game reserves and all wildlife outside national parks and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA). The NCA is managed by the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA). This is the only conservation area in Tanzania where humans, livestock and wildlife share the same environment (multiple use area).'
 'National parks are areas created and protected by law for the purpose of conservation of wildlife and its associated habitat. Examples of National Parks in Tanzania include Serengeti, Mikumi, Lake Manyara, Ruaha, Gombe, Mahale, Katavi, Kitulo, Saadani, Kilimanjaro, Mkomazi, Saanane Island, Rubondo, Nyerere National Park at Selous (the upper part of Selous), Udzungwa, and Tarangire. Game reserves include the lower part of Selous (which is the largest protected area in Tanzania), Rukwa, Ugalla, and Maswa.

 'Increase in population for settlement and agriculture expansion has led to encroachment on national parks and game reserves. This has led to degradation of wildlife areas, threatening their existence. In addition, crime and violent activities in some areas will discourage tourists from visiting such areas.  \n##### Promoting tourism in Tanzania:  \nThe following are the ways that can be used to promote tourism in Tanzania:  \n- Marketing strategies and publicity: Marketing of the tourism sector both domestically and internationally should be enhanced. There is a need for the government and other players in the industry to market aggressively the country’s tourist attractions in international media and forums.'
 '- Involving the local communities: Involvement of local communities will promote a sustainable tourism industry. Indeed, protection of national parks and game reserves needs the commitment of the people living near the parks and game reserves. Moreover, communities should enjoy the benefits obtained from the use of protected areas by tourists.\n- Promotion of domestic tourism: Domestic tourism is not well-developed in Tanzania because of the high costs and lack of touring interest among natives. Therefore, domestic tourism should be promoted by offering affordable rates to natives.

18,Can you generate a true or false statement about the advantages of nomadic pastoralism? I want to use it for form two classwork.,True or False: Managing livestock using traditional methods under nomadic pastoralism ensures the animals have a constant supply of water.,"['#### Advantages of nomadic pastoralism:  \n- Generally, managing livestock using traditional methods under nomadic pastoralism is cheap. It also ensures the availability of food to the family.\n- In addition, indigenous species of cattle such as Zebu, Boran, and Ankole are resistant to diseases.\n- Furthermore, the animals can tolerate walking over long distances and withstanding other environmental hardships such as high temperatures. They can also stay for a long time without water.\n- Likewise, the cattle are cheap to manage in terms of shelter.'
 '#### Disadvantages of nomadic pastoralism:  \nNomadic pastoralism suffers from lack of processing and storage facilities, hence causing a significant loss of the products. Also, over-grazing under nomadic pastoralism leads to soil erosion. Moreover, the control of diseases is difficult since animals are always on the move, which can affect the health of the animals and lower productivity in the process. For example, there have been cases of loss of large numbers of livestock due to lack of water and pasture. This situation affects the economy of the pastoralists. Furthermore, the practise of nomadic pastoralism tends to cause conflicts as they interfere with crop cultivators’ land. Because of their nomadic nature, many of the pastoralists’ children fail to attend formal education. As such, their periodic movements result in many of these children being denied their right to education and associated opportunities.'
 '#### Characteristics of nomadic pastoralism:  \nThe nomads normally move in groups. These groups are formed through the integration of families or members of a given ethnic group. A group involves a chief or elders who make decisions for the entire group. Indeed, large herd tends to cause overgrazing. Overgrazing is a situation where the number of cattle is greater than the carrying capacity of the grazing land. As a result, overgrazing causes soil erosion, land degradation, and loss of valuable species. Another feature of the nomadic pastoralists is the breeding process, which is uncontrolled. This situation may lead to the spread and outbreak of animal diseases, hence low animal quality and deaths.  \nIn addition, there is poor control of pests and other diseases, which result to poor quality of animal products. Furthermore, nomadic pastoralism takes place where the population is scarce as the animals are grazed in open range, which needs a lot of space.'
 'Nomadic pastoralism involves continual movement of pastoralists with large numbers of animals from place to place in search of pasture and water. People involved in this practice are called nomads or pastoralists. Tribes which practise nomadic pastoralism include the Maasai, Barbaig, Kwavi, and Karamajong. Nomadic pastoralism is mostly practised in sparsely populated areas where the natural vegetation is mainly grass and bushes and, sometimes, scattered trees. In these areas, rainfall is very low and unreliable. The pastoralists follow specific routes in their movements. Figure 2.10 shows a large herd of cattle. The animals kept by pastoralists are a source of food and income through the selling of animals and their products. Major products from animals are meat and milk. The pastoralists spend the money they earn to meet family needs such as buying cereals, paying school fees, and meeting health expenses. In addition, the cattle raised are used for paying bride price and giving gifts'
 '#### Transhumance:  \nTranshumance is a seasonal movement of livestock from one grazing ground to another, specifically to lowlands in winter and highlands in summer. It is a form of semi-nomadic pastoralism in which domestic animals play a predominant but not an exclusive role in shaping the economic and cultural life of the people who depend on them.  \nUnder transhumance, pastoralism is a predominant economic activity with varying emphasis on agriculture as a supplementary activity. Countries that practise transhumance include Switzerland, Morocco, Kosovo and the Sudan-Sahelian zone of Mali.  \n##### Advantages of transhumance:'

19,I need a descriptive exercise for my students about enhancements to tourist sites,"Exercise: 
Based on the context provided, design a plan to enhance a tourist site in Tanzania. Consider the following aspects:
1. Provision of training: Describe how you would provide training to local personnel to offer quality services to meet international standards at the tourist site.
2. Development of tourist attractions: Propose ideas on how to expand and diversify the tourist activities at the site to attract more visitors.
3. Improvement of infrastructure: Outline a plan to improve the existing accommodation, transport, and communication","['- Provision of training: Tourism is a service industry that demands quality services for its sustainability. It is, therefore, important to have trained personnel who can offer quality services to meet international standards. This, in turn, will lead to increased influx of tourists.\n- Development of tourist attractions: The government should invest in expanding the tourist attractions in the country. This can be done by opening up new areas and diversifying tourist activities but also by promoting them as viable alternatives.\n- Improvement of infrastructure: There is a need to improve the existing accommodation, transport and communication infrastructure. This will improve the provision of services needed by tourists in the hospitality industry.'
 '#### Improved infrastructure:  \nThe government has also invested in the improvement of infrastructure to facilitate access to tourist attractions. For example, there is a luxury train that runs between Swakopmund and Windhoek. Also, Air Namibia offers several scheduled domestic flights to enhance tourist movements. The private sector is also working closely with the government to improve accommodation facilities.'
 'Tourism services also generate the much-needed foreign currency. Tourists arrive in the country with convertible currencies which boost the country’s foreign currency. Moreover, taxes from this sector contribute to the growth of the national economy. This, in turn, lead to the development of other sectors such as health, education, infrastructure and water. Furthermore, existing roads are improved and new ones are built to connect tourist attraction sites. Airports are also developed and improved. Communication infrastructure is also improved to serve these areas.'
 '### Factors for the development and growth of tourism in the world  \nThe following are factors for the development and growth of tourism. These factors are features that encourage tourists to visit places for leisure, pleasure or education.  \n- Tourist attractions: Tourist attractions include places with pleasant climate, beautiful and varied sceneries, different cultures, historical sites and monuments. Also, some features in Tanzania such as Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest free-standing mountain in the world, attract tourists.\n- Advancement in communication and transportation network: Reliable communication network and advanced technology encourage the development of tourism in a country. For example, the use of the internet, television programmes, and social media, tourism trade fair and exhibitions has facilitated availability of information on tourism, hence it has led to an influx of tourists.'
 '#### Promoting access to tourist attraction centers:  \nThe distances between tourism sites in Namibia are large. This has forced the country to have a strong strategic upgrading of tourism infrastructure to promote the growth of the tourism industry.'

20,generaate an explanation question about challenges of subsistence farming in rural areas,Explain how the overuse of the same plots of land and the practice of burning vegetation during farm preparation contribute to the challenges faced by subsistence farmers in rural areas.,"['#### Disadvantages of small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop cultivation is associated with loss of soil fertility due to overuse of the same plots of land. Moreover, the practice of burning vegetation during farm preparation tends to destroy soil nutrients, hence lower its fertility. As a result, subsistence or peasant farmers’ yields tend to fall. Such low yields are also contributed by low use of fertilisers and pesticides. Therefore, various ways are needed to reduce the challenges of small-scale crop cultivation.'
 '#### Small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop cultivation is the growing of crops on a small piece of land. It is also called subsistence farming. It aims to produce enough food for the wellbeing of families. In some instances, when the production is high, the surplus is sold. Individuals engaging in small-scale crop cultivation are known as peasants. They are also called subsistence farmers as they grow food crops to feed themselves and their families with little or no surplus for sale.  \nAs noted earlier, the agricultural system at subsistence level falls under this category. A farmer owns a small piece of land for food crops cultivation. The produce is enough only for the family. It is hand to mouth existence which may lead to famine if the harvest is bad. In years with good harvest the farmer may have surplus to sell to the local markets. The farms are small, about one to five hectares owned by the family. Application of machines is difficult as farms are small.'
 '#### Relationship between population growth and small-scale crop production:  \nPopulation growth is an increase in the number of people in a particular area. Rapid population growth could be due to natural increase or in-migration. The rapid population growth puts more pressure on small-scale farmers. Yet, subsistence farmers are not likely to raise their output to feed the growing numbers because of lack of capital. Subsequently, land becomes overpopulated and resources overused. Also high population growth is associated with smaller farms and lower farm wages. As a result households in densely populated areas increasingly rely on off-farm income.'
 'In both countries, dairy farming is practised where there is adequate water supply and plenty of pasture. Overall, the development of the livestock-keeping sector is important in both countries. Moreover, the two countries practise livestock at both the subsistence and commercial levels. The animals and their products can be used to meet family needs and sometimes be sold to raise revenue. In Tanzania, sedentary livestock-keeping is practised in densely populated areas and, hence, with a shortage of land such as the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro and the Southern Highlands whereas in Australia it is practised specifically in the South East of the country.'
 '#### Bush fallowing:  \nBush fallowing is not different from shifting cultivation in that in bush fallowing people have permanent settlements. They clear the bush, burn the vegetation, and sow seeds. Yield declines after three to five years. The farm is left to regain its fertility for nearly ten years. Another bush is cleared and cultivated. No movement is involved in bush fallowing. This is possible in areas with dense population. Small-scale crop cultivation is advantageous to farmers. It allows them to grow varieties of food crops. Different crops grown in small farms make it easy to control pests and diseases. Elementary tools such as pangas, hand hoes and axes lead to low cost of running the farms, hence low capital involved. Farmers depend on rainfall only which is unreliable hence, during droughts the farmers suffer from famine.'
 'Traditional livestock farming is practised in areas where there is:\n(a) Very low rainfall\n(b) Heavy rainfall\n(c) No rainfall\n(d) Dry lands'

21,"Please, I need a short question about cultivated forests for form two students.",What are planted forests and what are two examples of planted forests in Tanzania mentioned in the textbook?,"['##### Forestry:  \nForestry is a set of practices that involve managing forests for ecological, social, and economic purposes. There are two types of forests: natural and man-made (planted) forests.  \n##### Planted forests:  \nPlanted forests are those in which trees are planted by human beings. They are commonly known as grown trees. The trees may be obtained locally or from other countries. In Tanzania, mahogany and teak are examples of local species whereas pines and eucalyptus are species from other countries. Some examples of planted forests in Tanzania include The Sao Hill forest plantation in Mafinga, Iringa Region and The West Kilimanjaro forest plantation in Kilimanjaro Region.'
 'Human activities: Forest distribution can also be influenced by human activities in different ways. For example, cultivation, herding and mining contribute to the disappearance of forests. Indeed, large-scale agriculture requires the clearance of large areas of forests. In the meantime, industrial demand for hard and soft wood necessitates people to increase the size of planted forests. Extensive planted forests in Tanzania are found at Sao Hill in Iringa and Kawetere in Mbeya.'
 '#### Planted forests:  \nPlanted forests refer to a collection of trees by human beings. These forests cover relatively large areas of land. Figure 4.7 shows part of a planted forest at Sao Hill in Iringa. Trees in these forests are of specific value such as commercial or land conservation. Planted forests are usually grown on a large-scale or small-scale basis. In many cases governments and companies or groups of people establish large-scale forests while small groups of people or individuals establish small-scale forests. In Tanzania, notable planted forests are in Iringa, Kagera, Kigoma, Kilimanjaro, and Arusha regions. Trees are established through seeding and planting of either native or exotic species. These forests are properly managed from planting to harvesting time to ensure high productivity.'
 '#### Characteristics of planted forests:  \nThe major characteristic of planted forests is pat pey are composed of trees which result from deliberate influence or intervention of human beings. However, pere are oper characteristics which distinguish pem from natural forests.  \nMost of the planted trees are of the same species because forest growers aim at specific tree species for targeted value. For example, at Sao Hill, most of the trees are pine and eucalyptus. Usually, trees in planted forests are of the same age because they are planted at the same time though the growth speed of the trees may vary. The difference in growth may cause them to be harvested at different periods. In addition, the difference in the harvesting of trees in planted forests may be caused by a system of planting trees in blocks.'
 'Planted forests are regularly cleaned by removing unwanted undergrowth, which may hinder the healthy growth of the planted species. Foresters provide close and strict supervision from planting to harvesting because of the commercial value of the trees. For example, planted trees in Sao Hill are for electrical polls, paper-making and timber production. Timber is sold locally or exported.'

22,"hi, need students to explain details about how natural springs are formed for classwork",Explain how natural springs are formed based on the information provided in the textbook excerpt.,"['#### Springs  \nSprings refer to natural overflows onto the land surface after the aquifer has been filled with infiltrating water, or when the water table meets the earth’s surface. The amount of water released from the spring depends on the nature of the rocks and the position of the water table. A large amount of water from a spring can form a river while small amounts may form small channels.'
 '#### Underground water  \nUnderground water is water beneath the earth’s surface particularly in the faults or joints of rocks and soil pores. Usually, underground water is found in the rock spaces (aquifers) which collect after infiltration through rock faults or joints. The rocks that allow water to seep through are called permeable rocks. The rocks with holes or pores through which water can pass are called porous rocks whereas rocks with joints or faults through which water infiltrates are called pervious rocks. The process of underground water formation primarily depends on the amount of rainfall in a particular area and the nature of rocks found there. When rain falls, water infiltrates through the soil and fills the joints and forms underground water. The water becomes naturally stored and ultimately gets out through springs, bore holes, and wells.'
 '#### Surface water:  \nSurface water is water that exists in streams and lakes. This water is primarily used for potable water supply, recreation, irrigation, industry, livestock, transportation, and hydroelectric energy. Over 63 percent of the public water supply is withdrawn from surface water. Irrigation gets 58 percent of its water supply from surface water. Industry gets almost 98 percent of its water from surface water systems. Small amounts may come from small channels.  \nSome springs release hot water, hence the name ""hot springs"". Other springs may eject hot water and steam hence the tag ""geysers"".'
 '### Precipitation  \nPrecipitation is the falling of water from the clouds in form of rain, snow, sleet or hail. Figure 3.5 shows different forms of precipitation. It is the last stage that demonstrates the return of water to the earth’s surface after changing into a gaseous form. Precipitation may be heavy or light thereby creating heavy rain, snow or hail. Whereas rain is directly in liquid form, snow and hail are water in solid form as a result of freezing. Water reaches the ground in form of snow or hail after the temperature in the atmosphere fails to melt it completely before reaching the ground. Upon reaching the ground, which has higher temperature than the atmosphere, the snow and hail melt into liquid as surface run-off. Also some water infiltrates into the earth’s surface through soil and cracks.  \nFigure 3.5 Different forms of precipitation\nSource: pinterest.com-forms of precipitation'
 'Geothermal energy: Geothermal energy refers to the heat energy generated and stored in the earth. Tapping this energy involves pumping cold water into hot rock boreholes and extracting the steam through another borehole. Due to the force by which the hot water comes out, it has the ability to drive turbines to generate electricity. Geothermal power production is mostly found in volcanic areas. Geothermal evidence in Tanzania is found in Mara, Manyara, Mbeya, and Rukwa. In these areas, water naturally flows out as hot fountains. Geothermal evidence is also found in Kenya, South-Eastern Nigeria, Madagascar, USA, New Zealand, and Iceland. Figure 8.3 shows a geothermal plant generating electricity. Geothermal energy can be used for domestic purposes or on a large scale by industries. It was used during earliest times for bathing and space heating. The biggest disadvantage with geothermal energy is that it can only be produced at selected sites.'

 'Agriculture can be done by individual farmers, companies, or co-operative societies. Crop farming is the type of agriculture that involves the cultivation of land to produce crops. Crop farming can be practised to produce food crops and cash crops.  \nFood crops include rice, beans, cassava, maize, wheat, bananas, and potatoes whereas cash crops include sisal, coffee, tea, and cashew-nuts.

 '### Large-scale crop cultivation:  \nLarge-scale crop cultivation is a farming system that covers a large area of land to produce one type of crop for commercial purposes. This type of large-scale farming is also known as commercial agriculture.  \nIn large-scale crop cultivation, the type of farming practise is mostly monoculture, in which a single crop is produced in large quantities. In developing countries monoculture is associated with tropical and sub-tropical plantation which were established through European colonisation.

24,can you drop a define question for renewable energy challenges in the USA for my students?,Define the challenges facing solar and wind energy production in the USA.,"['#### Challenges facing solar and wind energy in USA:  \nAlthough USA has a large and strong economy, it faces challenges related to the wind and solar energy sector. The following are some of the challenges.  \nSolar panel efficiency: Most solar power panels are 10 – 20 percent efficient, as they are stationary and cannot move to capture the sun’s rays. That being the case, a large percentage of the energy from the sun remains largely untapped, although the cost of solar power has decreased.  \nReliability: Solar and wind energy are not reliable sources of energy because sunrays and wind happen naturally and human beings can hardly control their occurrence. The extent of solar and wind energy production will largely depend on the intensity of wind and sunrays and the technology available to tap them.'
 '#### Addressing challenges facing solar and wind energy in USA:  \nThe challenges facing solar and wind energy production may hinder the expected harnessing of this potential energy if deliberate efforts are not made to address them.  \nInstallation of wind turbines and solar panels: Solar and wind energy depends very much on the number and quality of wind turbines and solar panels. The higher the quality of gadgets available, the more the amount of energy produced. It is, therefore, advisable to install enough wind turbines and solar panels over a wide area to increase the amount of energy harnessed.  \nResearch: Research on solar and wind energy is likely to find some solutions to many challenges facing the production of energy from wind and the sun. Research may involve studying the behaviour of wind and new technologies for tapping solar energy day and night.'
 'Renewable and non-renewable energy: Renewable energy is energy generated from sources that are essentially inexhaustible. Examples of renewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, geothermal energy, tidal power, and hydroelectric power. Non-renewable energy includes conventional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which are likely to get depleted with use.  \nConventional and non-conventional energy: Conventional energy is an energy source which is fixed in nature like oil, gas, coal, and hydropower generation. It is also termed as non-renewable energy or thermal energy. The conventional energy resources are being used extensively; as a result, their known reserves have been depleted to a great extent. The use of conventional energy has emerging effects on the environment. The non-conventional energy involves energy generated by wind, tides, solar and biomass. These are renewable sources of energy and not exhaustible.'
 'Renewable energy sources: Renewable energy is any energy source that is naturally replaced. The energy can be derived from sunlight, tides, wind, water, geothermal, or hydroelectric action. Likewise, energy produced from the refining of various forms of biomass is often classified as renewable. The renewable energy sources are usually regarded as environmentally friendly because they release few chemicals that can harm the environment. These are energy resources that are naturally reused. Renewable sources are sustainable if they are carefully managed and maintained. They have minimal negative effects on the environment. Renewable energy sources include sunlight, geothermal heat, wind, tides, water, and various forms of biomass. Some of these energy sources are described in the following sub-sections.'
 '### Solar and wind energy harnessing in USA  \nUSA is one of the leading countries in the world harnessing energy from the Sun.

26,"Hello, can you help with a define question on Opencast mining for my form 2 students?",Define Opencast mining.,"['Surface mining is done by removing (stripping) surface vegetation, dirt, and, if necessary, layers of bedrock in order to reach buried ore deposits. Techniques of surface mining include: open-pit mining or open cast mining, which is the recovery of materials from an open pit in the ground; and quarrying, identical to open-pit mining except that it refers to sand, stone and clay. Open cast mining is the cheapest method of extracting minerals. This method is used to extract minerals which usually occur close to the earth’s surface. This method involves removing the top layers of the earth and other overlying materials above the mineral ores. Figure 5.3 shows an open cast mine. The extraction involves the use of earth moving machines and bulldozers, and electric shovels. Sometimes explosion is used to blow overlying materials in order to reach the ore beneath. This method is cheaper because the output is bigger than the costs of running. The open cast method is used to extract quarrying'
 'the output is bigger than the costs of running. The open cast method is used to extract quarrying limestone, coal, and other surface minerals.'
 'There are two main types of mining, namely, surface and underground mining. Minerals such as salts are found close to the earth surface; as such, open cast method of mining is used to exploit them. Other minerals like gold and diamond are found deep in the ground, hence undergound mining methods are used to obtain them.  \nThe world is full of different types of minerals. Minerals can be classified into five main groups, that is, rocks used as building stones, and for brick making; non-metallic minerals such as salt, sulphur, nitrates, and asbestos; metals like gold, iron, and silver; mineral fuels including coal, petroleum and gas; and water. The whole of the earth, therefore, is full of minerals which are of great value to human beings.'
 '#### Mining  \nMining is a process of extracting valuable geological substances from the crust of the earth. The extracted materials may be minerals, fossil fuels, and other geological materials. However, not all geological substances are categorized as minerals. In science, a mineral has specific characteristics such as being solid, inorganic, naturally occurring, has definite chemical composition and ordered internal structure. Although oil, coal and natural gas do not possess most of these characteristics, they may be categorized as minerals. From a non-scientific view, a mineral refers to a non-living naturally occurring resource from the earth. As such, oil, coal, and natural gas also qualify to be called mineral resources. Thus, petroleum and natural gas which are discussed as case studies in this chapter are treated as minerals. Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water.'
 '#### Mining industry  \nMining is the branch of manufacturing industries and trade based on the extraction of ores, fossil fuels, minerals, stone, clay, gravel, and similar commodities. This does not include the refinement of these commodities.

Solar and wind energy in USA is important in so many ways.  \nEnvironmentally-friendly: The production of solar and wind energy involves activities which produce less waste in the environment compared to other sources of energy. These energies, therefore, are considered to be environmentally-friendly. For example, their production reduces the emission of carbon-dioxide and other pollutants.  \nCreation of employment opportunities: Installation and management of solar panels and wind mills require many employees. This industry generates jobs for thousands of people.'
 '#### Challenges facing solar and wind energy in USA:  \nAlthough USA has a large and strong economy, it faces challenges related to the wind and solar energy sector. The following are some of the challenges.  \nSolar panel efficiency: Most solar power panels are 10 – 20 percent efficient, as they are stationary and cannot move to capture the sun’s rays. That being the case, a large percentage of the energy from the sun remains largely untapped, although the cost of solar power has decreased.  \nReliability: Solar and wind energy are not reliable sources of energy because sunrays and wind happen naturally and human beings can hardly control their occurrence. The extent of solar and wind energy production will largely depend on the intensity of wind and sunrays and the technology available to tap them.'
 'Solar energy is harnessed on a large- scale in the states of California, Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina, New Jersey and Massachusetts. These areas are more conducive for harnessing solar power because of the sunny climate, clear skies and plenty of land. The electricity generated is integrated into the US National Grid.  \nWind energy is also used more in USA compared to solar energy. The country has a big potential of onshore and offshore winds. Wind energy is used in running large farms and industries. The leading wind energy producing centers are California, Oklahoma, Illinois, and Kansas. Wind power generation and use in USA is expanding quickly. It experiences an annual growth of 25.6 percent. For example, in 2017, wind power generated 6.3 percent of electricity in the USA.'

28,"hello, can u create a question about nomadic farming where students need to explain in detail?",Explain some of the disadvantages of nomadic pastoralism as discussed in the textbook.,"['Nomadic pastoralism involves continual movement of pastoralists with large numbers of animals from place to place in search of pasture and water. People involved in this practice are called nomads or pastoralists. Tribes which practise nomadic pastoralism include the Maasai, Barbaig, Kwavi, and Karamajong. Nomadic pastoralism is mostly practised in sparsely populated areas where the natural vegetation is mainly grass and bushes and, sometimes, scattered trees. In these areas, rainfall is very low and unreliable. The pastoralists follow specific routes in their movements. Figure 2.10 shows a large herd of cattle. The animals kept by pastoralists are a source of food and income through the selling of animals and their products. Major products from animals are meat and milk. The pastoralists spend the money they earn to meet family needs such as buying cereals, paying school fees, and meeting health expenses. In addition, the cattle raised are used for paying bride price and giving gifts'
 '#### Characteristics of nomadic pastoralism:  \nThe nomads normally move in groups. These groups are formed through the integration of families or members of a given ethnic group. A group involves a chief or elders who make decisions for the entire group. Indeed, large herd tends to cause overgrazing. Overgrazing is a situation where the number of cattle is greater than the carrying capacity of the grazing land. As a result, overgrazing causes soil erosion, land degradation, and loss of valuable species. Another feature of the nomadic pastoralists is the breeding process, which is uncontrolled. This situation may lead to the spread and outbreak of animal diseases, hence low animal quality and deaths.  \nIn addition, there is poor control of pests and other diseases, which result to poor quality of animal products. Furthermore, nomadic pastoralism takes place where the population is scarce as the animals are grazed in open range, which needs a lot of space.'
 '#### Disadvantages of nomadic pastoralism:  \nNomadic pastoralism suffers from lack of processing and storage facilities, hence causing a significant loss of the products. Also, over-grazing under nomadic pastoralism leads to soil erosion. Moreover, the control of diseases is difficult since animals are always on the move, which can affect the health of the animals and lower productivity in the process. For example, there have been cases of loss of large numbers of livestock due to lack of water and pasture. This situation affects the economy of the pastoralists. Furthermore, the practise of nomadic pastoralism tends to cause conflicts as they interfere with crop cultivators’ land. Because of their nomadic nature, many of the pastoralists’ children fail to attend formal education. As such, their periodic movements result in many of these children being denied their right to education and associated opportunities.'
 'In addition, low capital investment limits the development of the livestock- keeping sector in the country. Also, inadequate land for grazing leads to conflicts between farmers and pastoralists. Nomadic pastoralists, for example, always move from one place to another in search of pasture and water. As a result, they sometimes graze on the farms, hence conflicts arise between them and farmers. With nomadic pastoralism, the animals get tired due to long distances over which they move. Sometimes, the animals get sick and die, thus leading to low production in terms of quality and quantity.  \n##### Ways of solving challenges facing livestock-keeping in Tanzania:'
 '#### Semi-nomadism:  \nSemi-nomadism is a transition between total nomadism and sedentary animal keeping. It involves keeping a large number of animals especially cattle. Tribes which practice semi-nomadism include the Turkana of northern Kenya. The people involved in semi-nomadism usually travel away from their home for long periods during the dry season in search of pasture and water. This season is associated with scarcity of grass and water. Also, the semi-nomads’ movements contribute to the spread of diseases among their livestock. Semi-nomads usually cultivate crops during the rainy season to sustain their lives.'

29,Can you send me a quick question about the benefits of subsistence farming?,What are three advantages of small-scale crop cultivation mentioned in the textbook?,"['#### Small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop cultivation is the growing of crops on a small piece of land. It is also called subsistence farming. It aims to produce enough food for the wellbeing of families. In some instances, when the production is high, the surplus is sold. Individuals engaging in small-scale crop cultivation are known as peasants. They are also called subsistence farmers as they grow food crops to feed themselves and their families with little or no surplus for sale.  \nAs noted earlier, the agricultural system at subsistence level falls under this category. A farmer owns a small piece of land for food crops cultivation. The produce is enough only for the family. It is hand to mouth existence which may lead to famine if the harvest is bad. In years with good harvest the farmer may have surplus to sell to the local markets. The farms are small, about one to five hectares owned by the family. Application of machines is difficult as farms are small.'
 'The resulting population growth affects land use patterns. This may cause shortage of food and poor living standards. The solution to this problem is to improve small-scale crop cultivation. The government and other organisations should help farmers by providing them with education and capital to make subsistence agriculture more intensive and more productive. Moreover, the government, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and co-operative societies should help the farmers to select better seeds, use proper insecticides, pesticides, and apply fertilisers properly. In addition, they should help in providing transport to make sure the products reach proper storage places and markets. Furthermore, the government should emphasise and support the opening of joint agriculture ventures, finding of markets for surplus products and establishing good storage facilities. Additionally, deliberate efforts should be made to provide education on good farming practises, for example, the use of simple'
 'In both countries, dairy farming is practised where there is adequate water supply and plenty of pasture. Overall, the development of the livestock-keeping sector is important in both countries. Moreover, the two countries practise livestock at both the subsistence and commercial levels. The animals and their products can be used to meet family needs and sometimes be sold to raise revenue. In Tanzania, sedentary livestock-keeping is practised in densely populated areas and, hence, with a shortage of land such as the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro and the Southern Highlands whereas in Australia it is practised specifically in the South East of the country.'
 '#### Advantages of small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop production is cheap to operate since it involves the use of simple farming tools such as hand hoes and machetes. It is also cheap because the sources of labour are family members and, hence, easy to manage. In addition, small-scale agriculture needs small capital since it operates on small pieces of land. This type of agriculture when integrated with livestock-keeping provides biomass which is useful in the production of biogas energy. This energy is commonly used for cooking. Another advantage of small-scale crop cultivation is that farmers get fresh food such as vegetables and fruits. Therefore, small-scale agriculture contributes to the development of local communities.'
 'Agriculture can be done by individual farmers, companies, or co-operative societies. Crop farming is the type of agriculture that involves the cultivation of land to produce crops. Crop farming can be practised to produce food crops and cash crops.  \nFood crops include rice, beans, cassava, maize, wheat, bananas, and potatoes whereas cash crops include sisal, coffee, tea, and cashew-nuts.

30,can I get a long question on environmental pollution from industries for the students to write a detailed answer?,Explain the concept of industrial pollution and provide detailed examples of at least three different types of pollutants that are harmful to human health and the environment. How can these pollutants be controlled or reduced according to the information provided in the textbook?,"['#### Industrial pollution:  \nThe manufacturing process turns raw materials into useful goods. But some of the by-products of manufacturing waste materials left over or substances produced by the manufacturing process itself, may be harmful to the environment. Manufacturing contributes to air and water pollution for example the Wazo Hill Cement industry in Dar es Salaam.'
 '### Major ways of reducing industrial pollution  \nThere are several ways of reducing pollution from industries. These ways include the following.  \n- (a) Locating industries away from residential areas. There should be a proper policy on locating industries.\n- (b) Laws and by-laws should be enacted to protect the environment against pollution.\n- (c) Encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy which are environmental friendly, for example, the use of solar energy and hydro-electric power.\n- (d) Complete combustion of fuels in industrial machines should be ensured as it reduces air pollution.\n- (e) Liquid waste from industries should be treated before it is discharged as waste, to reduce the effects on the environment.\n- (f) Industrial waste can be reduced through re-use and recycling of plastic materials, bottles and cans to produce other materials.\n- (g) Routine inspection and maintenance of industrial machines should be carried out on a regular basis.'
 '### Pollutants from manufacturing industries:  \nIndustrial pollutants are substances that make air, water and soil harmful to living organisms. The manufacturing industries produce different pollutants which are dangerous to human health and the environment. These pollutants are categorized as gas, solids, liquids and noise.'
 '#### Air pollution:  \nPollution can easily be observed from oil refining industries. These manufacturing industries use heat from coal or diesel furnaces to provide steam power to run the plants. Burning this fuel can also release pollutants into the air.'
 '### Water pollution  \nWater pollution occurs when harmful substances of different quality, quantity and form are mixed in underground water. The water may be polluted through discharging waste in it or mixing it with chemicals usually from factories and industries. Besides, water pollution is also caused by domestic practices especially channelling toilet waste into water streams. All the materials which pollute water are called pollutants. Water pollution is at times caused by the construction of latrines directly in the ground. This way of pollution affects mostly underground water. The latrines tend to seep wastes into the underground water. Many homes and industries with no access to sewerage systems rely on shallow underground disposal of waste.'

 '#### Addressing challenges facing solar and wind energy in USA:  \nThe challenges facing solar and wind energy production may hinder the expected harnessing of this potential energy if deliberate efforts are not made to address them.  \nInstallation of wind turbines and solar panels: Solar and wind energy depends very much on the number and quality of wind turbines and solar panels. The higher the quality of gadgets available, the more the amount of energy produced. It is, therefore, advisable to install enough wind turbines and solar panels over a wide area to increase the amount of energy harnessed.  \nResearch: Research on solar and wind energy is likely to find some solutions to many challenges facing the production of energy from wind and the sun. Research may involve studying the behaviour of wind and new technologies for tapping solar energy day and night.'
 '### Solar and wind energy harnessing in USA  \nUSA is one of the leading countries in the world harnessing energy from the Sun. Before 2008, much of the electricity was generated from other sources such as fossil fuel and HEP. By 2018, solar power accounted for 1.44 percent of the total USA electricity, generating about 58.9 terawatt-hours (TWH).  \nUSA needs energy that is secure, reliable, protective of the environment, and able to address climate change, create jobs and improve public health. USA reduced the use of fossil fuel as a source of energy because it is expensive and not renewable. The American Government reduces the cost of solar power and increases the cost of fossil fuel to encourage use of the former. USA, as a highly developed country in terms of technology and economy, has a very high demand for power and energy for industrial and domestic use.'
 'Renewable and non-renewable energy: Renewable energy is energy generated from sources that are essentially inexhaustible. Examples of renewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, geothermal energy, tidal power, and hydroelectric power. Non-renewable energy includes conventional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which are likely to get depleted with use.  \nConventional and non-conventional energy: Conventional energy is an energy source which is fixed in nature like oil, gas, coal, and hydropower generation. It is also termed as non-renewable energy or thermal energy. The conventional energy resources are being used extensively; as a result, their known reserves have been depleted to a great extent. The use of conventional energy has emerging effects on the environment. The non-conventional energy involves energy generated by wind, tides, solar and biomass.

Natural gas is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, care has to be when extracting this resource. Natural gas production is new in Tanzania and, thus, it faces a shortage of skilled labour, especially in exploration and extraction activities. As a result, the government is often forced to employ foreign experts who are paid high salaries. Regarding the capacity to produce the natural gas, Tanzania has not been able to allocate enough funds for exploration, extraction, processing and distribution.'
 '#### Tanzania’s efforts in addressing the challenges of natural gas production  \nTanzania has been trying to overcome the challenges associated with the production of its natural gas. The government has been emphasising the use of revenue from natural gas to benefit the people in the areas producing the gas and the nation as a whole. The revenue from natural gas is used to improve social services in education and health. There have been various public programmes aimed to educate the public on natural gas benefits. The ministries responsible for energy and mineral resources in Tanzania conduct awareness creation programmes through various ways such as meetings and the media. The government also provides opportunities for training to Tanzanians in oil and natural gas. These training opportunities aim to build the country’s capacity for exploration, extraction, processing and supplying of natural gas.'
 'Tanzania benefits a lot from its natural gas resources. The resources benefit the economy of the country but also improve the lives of its people. Natural gas has contributed to the improvement of infrastructure. Transport and communication systems to and from source of natural gas areas have been improved. For example, the discovery and extraction of gas in Mtwara Region has stimulated improvement of the airport and the harbour in the region. As a result, air transport to and from Mtwara Region has also improved. Natural gas has also created the demand for labour, goods and services. There has been an increase in the demand for both skilled and unskilled labour to work in the mines and carry out mining-related activities. Moreover, natural gas extraction has added a source of income for the people. Companies involved in natural gas extraction usually pay taxes and other dues to the government. People living nearby natural gas extraction fields also benefit by selling goods,'

The type of agriculture practised in a given place is determined by various conditions of the area including climate, water availability, soil characteristics and terrain. It is also influenced by financial resources, infrastructure, technology and conditions of the market.'
 'Agriculture can be done by individual farmers, companies, or co-operative societies. Crop farming is the type of agriculture that involves the cultivation of land to produce crops. Crop farming can be practised to produce food crops and cash crops.  \nFood crops include rice, beans, cassava, maize, wheat, bananas, and potatoes whereas cash crops include sisal, coffee, tea, and cashew-nuts. Figure 1.1 shows a rice paddy.  \nFigure 1.1 Rice paddy  \nSource: Mwakalinga 03 June 2016: ippmedia.com'
 '#### Types of large-scale crop cultivation:  \nLarge-scale crop cultivation can be divided into two types: plantation agriculture and extensive food cultivation. Plantation agriculture involves cultivation of cash crops on estates. The cultivation is highly mechanised. Major crops grown on plantations include coffee, cotton, tea, rubber, oil palms, cocoa, sisal, and sugar cane. Plantation agriculture is dominant in some regions of Africa, Asia, North and South America where there are favourable climatic conditions. Extensive food cultivation deals with large-scale food crop production. Machines are highly used in ploughing, sowing, harvesting, processing, packaging, and transportation of farm produce. Crops grown under extensive agriculture are cereals which include beans, maize, and wheat. A description of some of the crops under large-scale crop production is provided in the following sub-sections.'
 '#### Characteristics of small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop cultivation is characterised by the following features:  \n(a) The harvest from the farm is used for family consumption.\n(b) It is practised on small pieces of land, often less pan five acres in size.\n(c) Peasants use simple tools such as hand-hoes and machetes for cultivation. In some cases, ox-driven ploughs are used.\n(d) Farmers often grow different types of crops on the same field. This technique is known as intercropping. The crops grown may include grains such as beans, maize and millet.\n(e) It is associated wip the use of organic manure to improve soil fertility.\n(f) Farming activities are mainly done by family members.'

38,Please give a true or false statement for the students to answer about essential conditions for coffee cultivation.,True or False: Coffee plants require direct sunlight for optimal growth.,"['#### Conditions necessary for growing coffee:  \nThere are four essential growth conditions required for the cultivation of coffee:  \n##### Climate  \nCoffee is a tropical plant, which is also grown in semi-tropical climate. It requires heat, humidity, and abundant rainfall. The plant grows in warm to hot temperature ranging between 16°-21°C. Coffee needs abundant rainfall ranging from 1100 mm to 1780 mm annually and a relatively dry season for picking. Growth is most rapid during the hot rainy season, and during the cool dry season berries ripen and are ready for picking. Growth is most rapid during the hot rainy season, and during the cool dry season berries ripen and are ready for picking. Bright sunshine and warm weather are necessary for the harvesting. Hill slopes, which receive orographic rainfall, are thus best for coffee cultivation.  \n##### Shade'
 'vi. Providing a lively habitat, which is able to harbor different bird species. The birds help to facilitate pollination and serve as a biological insect control. Due to increasing demand of coffee, a scientific way of productivity which involve growing coffee plants in the open sun, was developed for coffee farming. This approach is accompanied with the continued application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides which, among other things, make up for the loss of nutrients.  \n##### Topography  \nGenerally, coffee is grown on slopes having a height between 600 to 1,800 meters. Water stagnation is very harmful for coffee plants; therefore, hill slopes are best suitable for growing coffee.  \n##### Soils  \nSoil is the guiding factor in coffee plantation. Coffee plantation requires deep well drained soils which are rich in humus, minerals nutrients and of good texture to allow free air circulation.'
 '### Coffee:  \nCoffee is a crop which produces coffee beans that are processed to make a beverage (Figure 2.1). It forms an important cash crop for export. In Tanzania, coffee is grown in Kagera, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Mbeya, Katavi, Iringa, Mara, Njombe, tanga, Morogoro, Kigoma, and Ruvuma regions (Figure 2.2). Coffee is also grown in Kenya, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, Rwanda and Ethiopia. Other countries include Cameroon, Brazil, Columbia, Indonesia, Honduras, India, Vietnam, The Philippines and Mexico. There are over 60 varieties of coffee yet only two of them have commercial importance; these are Arabica and Robusta.'
 '##### Shade  \nDirect sunlight is harmful for coffee plants; therefore, these are planted under shade of taller trees such as bananas. An ideal shade tree should belong to the leguminous type, because these not only provide shade but also enrich soil with nitrogen. Traditionally, most of the varieties of coffee plants were shade grown, as they were naturally intolerant of direct sunlight, hence they preferred a canopy of sun-filtering shade trees. The trees in coffee plantations play several roles including the following:  \nFigure 2.2 Coffee-producing regions in Tanzania  \nSource: Coffeeboard.or.tz/news_Publications2009  \ni. Protecting coffee from direct sunlight. Trees reduce the amount of heat reaching the coffee plant during the daytime.  \nii. Acting as physical barrier by protecting coffee plants from destruction by winds.'
 '#### Farm preparation, planting, and care of coffee:  \nCoffee farms need preparation for at least six months. The coffee seedlings are raised on seed-beds and transplanted after six months, with three meters spacing. The coffee trees are pruned annually to ensure maximum yield. Pruning is also done to facilitate the picking of coffee beans. Weeds such as star-grass and couch grass are removed to increase yield. Pruning is also done to facilitate the picking of coffee beans. Weeds such as star-grass and couch grass are removed to increase yields. In addition, spraying of coffee plants is done in cases of least rusting and Coffee Berry Diseases (CBD).

HEP is one of the main sources of power in Tanzania. In Tanzania, electricity generation depends heavily on HEP. However, this type of energy cannot be relied upon in times of drought. The government through the Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO), a parastatal organization, manages the HEP across the country. The company produces hydro-electricity from natural waterfalls or man-made dams and supplies it to the users in the country.'
 '### Importance of HEP and biogas energy resources in Tanzania  \nTanzania’s major electrical energy is obtained primarily from HEP followed by natural gas. These energy sources are important to the economy of the country. HEP and biogas energy are important in many ways.  \nUse at the local level: Production of biogas requires simple technology, which can be handled by any interested person. Based on technological simplicity, biogas is prominent at local levels in Tanzania.  \nWaste management: Use of biogas enhances management of wastes mainly animal dung. All animal dung around people’s homes is collected and ferried to the processing area to produce power. People with many livestock find biogas production as an effective way of keeping their areas clean.'
 '## Chapter Eight (Sustainable use of power and energy resources)  \n### Introduction  \nPower and energy are important for every aspect of human life.

You will also learn about the problems facing power and energy production, specifically solar and wind power production in the USA, hydroelectric and biogas production in Tanzania. Finally, you will learn about problems related to power and energy extraction in the USA and Tanzania.'
 '### Addressing challenges to power and energy harnessing in Tanzania:  \nDespite the challenges to harnessing power and energy, the following are some of the solutions to the challenges facing power and energy harnessing in Tanzania.  \nAlternative sources of power: Alternative sources of power to support the existing sources should be explored to meet the increasing power demand in Tanzania. By 2013, the annual power demand increase was between 10 percent and 15 percent. The demand for power and energy is expected to increase because of the new industries that are to be constructed.  \nFunds allocation for exploration: The government is required to allocate adequate funds for exploring other sources of power. Tanzania is endowed with many power and energy sources, which have not been yet harnessed due to lack of capital.  \nTraining of skilled personnel: More young Tanzanians should be trained on HEP and biogas exploration and production.'
 '### Challenges to harnessing power and energy in Tanzania:  \nPower and energy harnessing in Tanzania faces various challenges ranging from naturally occurring to human-made ones. The following are some of the challenges facing power and energy harnessing in Tanzania.  \nFluctuation of river volume: In the dry season, rain may be scarce or completely absent which reduces water in dams and, consequently, lowers the generation of HEP. Tanzania has been experiencing periods of power-cut particularly during the dry season because of over-dependence on HEP.'

40,Prepare a true or false question regarding natural springs for our geography class.,True or False: Springs refer to artificial overflows onto the land surface after the aquifer has been filled with infiltrating water.,"['#### Springs  \nSprings refer to natural overflows onto the land surface after the aquifer has been filled with infiltrating water, or when the water table meets the earth’s surface. The amount of water released from the spring depends on the nature of the rocks and the position of the water table. A large amount of water from a spring can form a river while small amounts may form small channels.'
 '#### Mining  \nMining is a process of extracting valuable geological substances from the crust of the earth. The extracted materials may be minerals, fossil fuels, and other geological materials. However, not all geological substances are categorized as minerals. In science, a mineral has specific characteristics such as being solid, inorganic, naturally occurring, has definite chemical composition and ordered internal structure. Although oil, coal and natural gas do not possess most of these characteristics, they may be categorized as minerals. From a non-scientific view, a mineral refers to a non-living naturally occurring resource from the earth. As such, oil, coal, and natural gas also qualify to be called mineral resources. Thus, petroleum and natural gas which are discussed as case studies in this chapter are treated as minerals. Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water.'
 '#### Surface water:  \nSurface water is water that exists in streams and lakes. This water is primarily used for potable water supply, recreation, irrigation, industry, livestock, transportation, and hydroelectric energy. Over 63 percent of the public water supply is withdrawn from surface water. Irrigation gets 58 percent of its water supply from surface water. Industry gets almost 98 percent of its water from surface water systems. Small amounts may come from small channels.  \nSome springs release hot water, hence the name ""hot springs"". Other springs may eject hot water and steam hence the tag ""geysers"".'
 '#### Underground water  \nUnderground water is water beneath the earth’s surface particularly in the faults or joints of rocks and soil pores. Usually, underground water is found in the rock spaces (aquifers) which collect after infiltration through rock faults or joints. The rocks that allow water to seep through are called permeable rocks. The rocks with holes or pores through which water can pass are called porous rocks whereas rocks with joints or faults through which water infiltrates are called pervious rocks. The process of underground water formation primarily depends on the amount of rainfall in a particular area and the nature of rocks found there. When rain falls, water infiltrates through the soil and fills the joints and forms underground water. The water becomes naturally stored and ultimately gets out through springs, bore holes, and wells.'
 'Hydro-electric power energy: Hydro- electric power is created by the force of flowing water from mountains or high landform streams. Thus hydro-electric power is a result of water in motion. Moving water possesses energy which can be converted into electric energy if the following conditions are met:\n(i) There should be a constant supply of water. This is possible if the sources of water are areas where there is heavy rainfall, natural lake or melting water from mountain glaciers. It is also possible where there is a reservoir that could be a lake or dam to store the water needed.\n(ii) There must be a ready market for the power generated. The aim is to minimise the cost of transmitting electricity.\n(iii) The ground has to be steep to allow fast flow of water. For example, a waterfall that can drive hydro turbines.'

In an equatorial rainforest, the vegetation grows in layers. The upper layer forms a continuous canopy, which provides shade for lower layers. Trees grow to over 80 metres high. The second or middle layer grows up to about 30 metres high. The lower canopy grows to a range of 5 to 15 metres high. It consists of shrubs, palms and ferns with little undergrowth.  \nThe trees in this tropical rainforest are of different species, which include mahogany, rosewood, greenheart, ironwood and ebony. Most trees have large buttress roots. In addition, tropical rainforests contain climber trees.  \nNearly all the trees are broad-leaved and evergreen due to the availability of rainfall throughout the year. However, due to constant climatic conditions, plants produce flowers, fruits and shade their leaves at the same time.'
 '#### Characteristics of a tropical monsoon forest  \nA monsoon forest has characteristics that distinguish it from other types of forests. Monsoon forests contain thick undergrowth of shrubs and small trees. This poses a challenge to people and animals when it comes to passing through these forests. However, the forest is more open compared to equatorial rainforests. The main trees in these forests are teak, acacia, casuarina, and bamboo. Trees in this forest are moderately tall compared to trees of other types of forests. They grow up to 30 meters high. Trees are not as close as in tropical evergreen forests. Due to this reason, the undergrowth tends to be a bit thick.'
 '#### Equatorial rainforest:  \nThis type of forest is found in the equatorial region between 5˚N and 5˚S of the Equator. In this forest there are large and tall trees that grows to over 80 metres high. Figure 4.2 shows an equatorial rainforest.\nIn Tanzania, equatorial rainforests are found in coastal areas, Kagera, Kilimanjaro and Kigoma regions. Other areas in the rest of the world that have equatorial rainforests are low-lying lands of the Congo Basin in Central Africa and the coastal lands of West Africa. This type of forest is also found in the Gulf of Guinea, West of Sierra Leone, Cameroon and Gabon, Eastern Coast of Madagascar, Amazon Basin and Malaysia.  \nFigure 4.1 Distribution of the world’s natural forests'
 '#### Tropical monsoon forests:  \nTropical monsoon forests consist of deciduous trees that shed their leaves during the dry season. Figure 4.4 shows a section of a monsoon forest. These forests are located in the monsoon climate beyond the equatorial region between 10º and 25º North and South of the Equator. These forests are found in areas with seasonal rainfall, along coastal regions of Southwest India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, South Western Africa, and North-East and South-East Brazil.  \n| Figure 4.3 Mangrove forest                     | Figure 4.4 Tropical monsoon forest           |\n| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| Source: https://www.animalwised.com/endangered | Source: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tropical |'
 'The amount of water supply in a particular area also determines the type of vegetation growth. For example, due to their semi-arid climatic conditions, central parts of Tanzania such as Dodoma and Singida experience little rainfall in a year. The vegetation cover is mainly shrubs with little influence on the formation of rainfall. On the other hand, areas with equatorial climate are covered with thick vegetation (equatorial rainforests). This type of vegetation has a significant influence on rain formation due to high rates of evapotranspiration determined by high temperatures in these regions. High rainfall results in adequate water supply.'

 'Water is also a source of electrical power. Modern economies depend much on the supply of electricity. One of the sources of electric power is water to produce what is commonly known as hydroelectric power (HEP). HEP is one of the cheapest and environmentally friendly sources of power. This power is used in industries to run machines, transport goods and provide services as well as in communication systems. Moreover, power contributes to the establishment of small and large-scale economic activities which eventually contribute to the economic growth of a given country. Furthermore, water is useful in the navigation sector in various ways. Human beings navigate different vessels such as canoes, boats, ferries and ships to move people and goods. Transportation of heavy machines for factories and industries, vehicles, timber and logs is made possible on water. In Tanzania, water transport on lakes and oceans facilitates the importation and exportation of various goods such as machines'

You will also learn about the importance of forests in the ecological and environmental balance as well as challenges facing the forest industry.'
 '### The concept of forest  \nA forest is an extensive area of land mostly covered by trees of different sizes, species and other forms of undergrowth. By 2015, it was estimated that forests covered about 31% of the earth’s surface. Forest distribution on the earth’s surface varies. Such variation is caused by the amount of rainfall available and the length of wet and warm seasons per year. Forests can be absent in some areas even where the climatic conditions allow tree growth. Absence of forests in extensive areas can be caused by actions of human beings and wild animals.'
 '#### Importance of forests in ecological and environmental balance  \nEcology is the way in which plants, animals and people relate to each other and to their environment. Ecological and environmental balance is the mutual symbiotic system or state in which plants and animals benefit from each other, thus maintaining their survival in the environment. Plants, insects and animals live together in a particular environment. They live a symbiotic relationship by benefiting from each other. The specific roles forests play in fostering ecological and environmental balance are as elaborated in the paragraphs that follow:'
 'Medicinal value: Some forest trees have medicinal value. They have roots, leaves, and bark which are used as medicine or processed to make medicine for human beings and animals. For example, the bark of the cinchona tree is used in manufacturing quinine which is useful for treatment of malaria. Also, some trees are used in making herbicides for use in agriculture.  \nTourist attraction: Some forests have rare and unique species of animals and plants which attract people to observe. For example, Gombe Forests in Kigoma have chimpanzees, which are a great attraction for both local and foreign tourists. Many of the natural parks have forests that serve as habitats for attracting animals and plants.  \nRainfall formation: Areas with heavy forests are characterised by frequent rainfall. For example, in the Amazon forests, 30 percent of rainfall is said to be influenced by moist air from trees.'
 '##### Forestry:  \nForestry is a set of practices that involve managing forests for ecological, social, and economic purposes. There are two types of forests: natural and man-made (planted) forests.  \n##### Planted forests:  \nPlanted forests are those in which trees are planted by human beings. They are commonly known as grown trees. The trees may be obtained locally or from other countries. In Tanzania, mahogany and teak are examples of local species whereas pines and eucalyptus are species from other countries. Some examples of planted forests in Tanzania include The Sao Hill forest plantation in Mafinga, Iringa Region and The West Kilimanjaro forest plantation in Kilimanjaro Region.'

 '### Contribution of the mining industry to the economy of Tanzania:  \nMinerals are useful in the growth of any country’s economy. Some minerals have more demand than others due to their high value. Minerals are used in countries where they are produced and also they are exported to various countries to obtain foreign currency. The contribution of mining industries to the Tanzanian economy include the following:  \n- Government revenue: The mining industry contributes to government revenue in terms of taxes and royalties. This is crucial for financing developmental plans of the country.\n- Employment: The mining industry contributes direct and indirect employment opportunities within the country. Some people get employed directly in the industry while others provide services related to mining in mining centers.'

46,I need a defining question about Tropical monsoon forests for my form 2 students,What are the main trees commonly found in tropical monsoon forests?,"['#### Characteristics of a tropical monsoon forest  \nA monsoon forest has characteristics that distinguish it from other types of forests. Monsoon forests contain thick undergrowth of shrubs and small trees. This poses a challenge to people and animals when it comes to passing through these forests. However, the forest is more open compared to equatorial rainforests. The main trees in these forests are teak, acacia, casuarina, and bamboo. Trees in this forest are moderately tall compared to trees of other types of forests. They grow up to 30 meters high. Trees are not as close as in tropical evergreen forests. Due to this reason, the undergrowth tends to be a bit thick.'
 '#### Tropical monsoon forests:  \nTropical monsoon forests consist of deciduous trees that shed their leaves during the dry season. Figure 4.4 shows a section of a monsoon forest. These forests are located in the monsoon climate beyond the equatorial region between 10º and 25º North and South of the Equator. These forests are found in areas with seasonal rainfall, along coastal regions of Southwest India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, South Western Africa, and North-East and South-East Brazil.  \n| Figure 4.3 Mangrove forest                     | Figure 4.4 Tropical monsoon forest           |\n| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| Source: https://www.animalwised.com/endangered | Source: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tropical |'
 '#### Natural forests:  \nA natural forest refers to a collection of trees that have grown naturally. The types of natural forests include equatorial rainforest, tropical monsoon, deciduous, coniferous and mangrove. The natural forests are found in many countries. Figure 4.1 shows the distribution of various world natural forests.'
 '#### Characteristics of an equatorial rainforest  \nAn equatorial rainforest has some characteristics that distinguish it from other types of forests. In an equatorial rainforest, the vegetation grows in layers. The upper layer forms a continuous canopy, which provides shade for lower layers. Trees grow to over 80 metres high. The second or middle layer grows up to about 30 metres high. The lower canopy grows to a range of 5 to 15 metres high. It consists of shrubs, palms and ferns with little undergrowth.  \nThe trees in this tropical rainforest are of different species, which include mahogany, rosewood, greenheart, ironwood and ebony. Most trees have large buttress roots. In addition, tropical rainforests contain climber trees.  \nNearly all the trees are broad-leaved and evergreen due to the availability of rainfall throughout the year. However, due to constant climatic conditions, plants produce flowers, fruits and shade their leaves at the same time.'
 'Rainfall: The distribution of forests is also influenced by rainfall. Forests thrive well in areas with plenty of rainfall of over 1200 mm throughout the year. The dense equatorial forests have thrived well because of the presence of heavy rainfall that is well distributed throughout the year. In deciduous forest regions, trees that can survive the dry season exist. These trees shed their leaves during the dry season to reduce water loss through transpiration as their means of survival. Relief is another factor that influences the distribution of forests. It determines soil, temperature and vegetation distribution across gradient. Tree distribution varies with altitude. For example, on Mount Kilimanjaro at 1800-3000 m above sea level, forests consist of diverse tree species. At higher altitude (3000 m), alpine heath dominate. Thus, differences in relief are associated with variations in the type of forests.'

47,"Hello, can you create a true or false statement for my students to work on methods to mitigate industrial pollution?",True or False: Routine inspection and maintenance of industrial machines is not necessary for reducing industrial pollution.,"['### Major ways of reducing industrial pollution  \nThere are several ways of reducing pollution from industries. These ways include the following.  \n- (a) Locating industries away from residential areas. There should be a proper policy on locating industries.\n- (b) Laws and by-laws should be enacted to protect the environment against pollution.\n- (c) Encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy which are environmental friendly, for example, the use of solar energy and hydro-electric power.\n- (d) Complete combustion of fuels in industrial machines should be ensured as it reduces air pollution.\n- (e) Liquid waste from industries should be treated before it is discharged as waste, to reduce the effects on the environment.\n- (f) Industrial waste can be reduced through re-use and recycling of plastic materials, bottles and cans to produce other materials.\n- (g) Routine inspection and maintenance of industrial machines should be carried out on a regular basis.'
 '#### Industrial pollution:  \nThe manufacturing process turns raw materials into useful goods. But some of the by-products of manufacturing waste materials left over or substances produced by the manufacturing process itself, may be harmful to the environment. Manufacturing contributes to air and water pollution for example the Wazo Hill Cement industry in Dar es Salaam.'
 '### Pollutants from manufacturing industries:  \nIndustrial pollutants are substances that make air, water and soil harmful to living organisms. The manufacturing industries produce different pollutants which are dangerous to human health and the environment. These pollutants are categorized as gas, solids, liquids and noise.'
 '#### Industrial solid waste:  \nSolid waste such as paper and plastic products, bottles and cans, food and garden wastes from industries pollutes the environment. Waste is harmful as it may contribute to the transmission of diseases to human beings and plants.'
 '#### Air pollution:  \nPollution can easily be observed from oil refining industries. These manufacturing industries use heat from coal or diesel furnaces to provide steam power to run the plants. Burning this fuel can also release pollutants into the air.'

48,"Hi, I need a question on how solar and wind power are used in the USA, no long text please, just short answer type.",How is solar power integrated into the US National Grid?,"['Solar energy is harnessed on a large- scale in the states of California, Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina, New Jersey and Massachusetts. These areas are more conducive for harnessing solar power because of the sunny climate, clear skies and plenty of land. The electricity generated is integrated into the US National Grid.  \nWind energy is also used more in USA compared to solar energy. The country has a big potential of onshore and offshore winds. Wind energy is used in running large farms and industries. The leading wind energy producing centers are California, Oklahoma, Illinois, and Kansas. Wind power generation and use in USA is expanding quickly. It experiences an annual growth of 25.6 percent. For example, in 2017, wind power generated 6.3 percent of electricity in the USA.'
 '### Solar and wind energy harnessing in USA  \nUSA is one of the leading countries in the world harnessing energy from the Sun. Before 2008, much of the electricity was generated from other sources such as fossil fuel and HEP. By 2018, solar power accounted for 1.44 percent of the total USA electricity, generating about 58.9 terawatt-hours (TWH).  \nUSA needs energy that is secure, reliable, protective of the environment, and able to address climate change, create jobs and improve public health. USA reduced the use of fossil fuel as a source of energy because it is expensive and not renewable. The American Government reduces the cost of solar power and increases the cost of fossil fuel to encourage use of the former. USA, as a highly developed country in terms of technology and economy, has a very high demand for power and energy for industrial and domestic use.'
 '#### Importance of solar and wind energy in USA:  \nUSA finds it more economical to use solar and wind energy than other sources of energy as they have minimal environmental effects. Solar and wind energy in USA is important in so many ways.  \nEnvironmentally-friendly: The production of solar and wind energy involves activities which produce less waste in the environment compared to other sources of energy. These energies, therefore, are considered to be environmentally-friendly. For example, their production reduces the emission of carbon-dioxide and other pollutants.  \nCreation of employment opportunities: Installation and management of solar panels and wind mills require many employees. This industry generates jobs for thousands of people.'
 '#### Challenges facing solar and wind energy in USA:  \nAlthough USA has a large and strong economy, it faces challenges related to the wind and solar energy sector. The following are some of the challenges.  \nSolar panel efficiency: Most solar power panels are 10 – 20 percent efficient, as they are stationary and cannot move to capture the sun’s rays. That being the case, a large percentage of the energy from the sun remains largely untapped, although the cost of solar power has decreased.  \nReliability: Solar and wind energy are not reliable sources of energy because sunrays and wind happen naturally and human beings can hardly control their occurrence. The extent of solar and wind energy production will largely depend on the intensity of wind and sunrays and the technology available to tap them.'
 '#### Addressing challenges facing solar and wind energy in USA:  \nThe challenges facing solar and wind energy production may hinder the expected harnessing of this potential energy if deliberate efforts are not made to address them.  \nInstallation of wind turbines and solar panels: Solar and wind energy depends very much on the number and quality of wind turbines and solar panels. The higher the quality of gadgets available, the more the amount of energy produced. It is, therefore, advisable to install enough wind turbines and solar panels over a wide area to increase the amount of energy harnessed.  \nResearch: Research on solar and wind energy is likely to find some solutions to many challenges facing the production of energy from wind and the sun. Research may involve studying the behaviour of wind and new technologies for tapping solar energy day and night.'

As a result, skilled people from abroad who could serve the industry efficiently cannot easily get work permits. Other challenges facing tourism in Namibia include the growing rate of crime, corruption, poaching, poor water crisis management and high commodity prices.'
 '#### Challenges facing tourism in Namibia:  \nThe tourism industry in Namibia is facing strong competition for tourists from other neighbouring Burundi and the Democratic Republic of countries especially Botswana and South Africa. In addition, tourism industry in Namibia suffers from a shortage of a well-trained personnel who can offer standard services to tourists. Also, tourist opportunities are in the rural areas where the majority of the people are not well educated.

The export of petroleum and petroleum products has enabled Middle East countries to develop good transport networks. In addition, petroleum is a resource which provides energy and power for domestic and industrial purposes.'
 '#### Importance of oil production to Middle East countries:  \nThe Middle East is located in an arid region. Oil production has contributed to economic and social development of the Middle East countries. The countries depend greatly on the exportation of petroleum and petroleum products to earn foreign currency. Companies involved in oil production in most of the Middle East countries are mostly state-owned. However, there are also some oil fields run by private companies. These companies pay taxes to the government. The revenue from oil refining and support industries is used to provide social services such as education and health. The revenue is also used in the construction and improvement of infrastructure such as roads, railways, and airports. Jobs are also created in areas that produce oil as many people in the Middle East work in the petroleum refineries and petrochemical industries.'
 'Oil production in the Middle East faces many challenges. With rising global demand, highly volatile prices are increasingly becoming stringent. The oil and gas industry faces three major challenges involving how to reduce costs, optimize the performance of its industrial base assets, and address its environmental footprint. Environmental pollution is one of these challenges. Oil refinery and production of petroleum products produce carbon dioxide and other gases such as methane which are harmful. As countries in the Middle East have large oil production industries, the emission of harmful gases is also high. These gases contribute to the pollution of water, air, and land. Burning fossil fuels produces sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. When they move into the atmosphere they produce acid rain, which damages buildings and vegetation in addition to affecting fish and other organisms that live in water. Another challenge facing oil production in the Middle East has to do with civil wars'

Please provide a detailed long answer.","['#### Small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop cultivation is the growing of crops on a small piece of land. It is also called subsistence farming. It aims to produce enough food for the wellbeing of families. In some instances, when the production is high, the surplus is sold. Individuals engaging in small-scale crop cultivation are known as peasants. They are also called subsistence farmers as they grow food crops to feed themselves and their families with little or no surplus for sale.  \nAs noted earlier, the agricultural system at subsistence level falls under this category. A farmer owns a small piece of land for food crops cultivation. The produce is enough only for the family. It is hand to mouth existence which may lead to famine if the harvest is bad. In years with good harvest the farmer may have surplus to sell to the local markets. The farms are small, about one to five hectares owned by the family. Application of machines is difficult as farms are small.'

 'In both countries, dairy farming is practised where there is adequate water supply and plenty of pasture. Overall, the development of the livestock-keeping sector is important in both countries. Moreover, the two countries practise livestock at both the subsistence and commercial levels. The animals and their products can be used to meet family needs and sometimes be sold to raise revenue. In Tanzania, sedentary livestock-keeping is practised in densely populated areas and, hence, with a shortage of land such as the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro and the Southern Highlands whereas in Australia it is practised specifically in the South East of the country.'
 '#### Benefits of livestock-keeping:  \nLivestock-keeping stimulates the growth of industries that process different animal-related products such as hides, horns, and hooves as raw materials. It is also a source of income by selling animals and their products. In addition, livestock-keeping provides employment to people, which helps to improve their living conditions. Moreover, livestock-keeping contributes to government revenue.'

Residue from planting processed kernels can be used as animal fodder and manure.'
 '#### Harvesting, processing, storage, and transportation of oil palm:  \nThe fruits of the palm oil trees turn red when they are ripe and ready for harvesting. Each fruit consists of a fleshy pericarp surrounding a nut. Fruits are boiled in pots or drums at high temperature. The processing continues to the point where the pericarp is compressed to obtain palm oil. Inside the pericarp, there is a kernel which is also a source of oil. Oil from the kernel is obtained by crushing the nuts in a grinder and compressing them. The extracted palm oil is packed in containers ready for domestic use and export.'
 '### Oil palm:  \nOil palm is a plant grown in tropical areas specifically for producing palm oil. It is grown on both small-scale on farm lots and large-scale on plantations. In Tanzania palm oil is grown in Kigoma and Mbeya regions. Other palm oil growing countries in the world are Malaysia, Nigeria, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.'
 '#### Conditions necessary for growing oil palm:  \nOil palm grows well in areas with high temperatures throughout the year with mean monthly temperature of over 21°C, heavy rainfall throughout the year (about 1,500 mm to 2,040 mm), and needs a well-drained soil to enable water to pass through.'
 '#### Farm preparation, planting and care of oil palm:  \nFarm preparation takes place before transplanting. Palm oil seeds are sown in nurseries which are later transplanted to a farm when they are 12-14 months old. Palm oil plants begin bearing fruits when they are five years old and reach maximum production after 8-10 years. After ten years, yields start to decline. Palm fruits usually grow in large bunches.

The government has been emphasising the use of revenue from natural gas to benefit the people in the areas producing the gas and the nation as a whole. The revenue from natural gas is used to improve social services in education and health. There have been various public programmes aimed to educate the public on natural gas benefits. The ministries responsible for energy and mineral resources in Tanzania conduct awareness creation programmes through various ways such as meetings and the media. The government also provides opportunities for training to Tanzanians in oil and natural gas. These training opportunities aim to build the country’s capacity for exploration, extraction, processing and supplying of natural gas.'
 '#### Challenges of natural gas production in Tanzania:  \nNatural gas production faces numerous challenges in different aspects. Natural gas is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, care has to be when extracting this resource. Natural gas production is new in Tanzania and, thus, it faces a shortage of skilled labour, especially in exploration and extraction activities. As a result, the government is often forced to employ foreign experts who are paid high salaries. Regarding the capacity to produce the natural gas, Tanzania has not been able to allocate enough funds for exploration, extraction, processing and distribution.'
 '### Addressing challenges to power and energy harnessing in Tanzania:  \nDespite the challenges to harnessing power and energy, the following are some of the solutions to the challenges facing power and energy harnessing in Tanzania.  \nAlternative sources of power: Alternative sources of power to support the existing sources should be explored to meet the increasing power demand in Tanzania. By 2013, the annual power demand increase was between 10 percent and 15 percent. The demand for power and energy is expected to increase because of the new industries that are to be constructed.  \nFunds allocation for exploration: The government is required to allocate adequate funds for exploring other sources of power. Tanzania is endowed with many power and energy sources, which have not been yet harnessed due to lack of capital.  \nTraining of skilled personnel: More young Tanzanians should be trained on HEP and biogas exploration and production.'
 'Tanzania benefits a lot from its natural gas resources. The resources benefit the economy of the country but also improve the lives of its people. Natural gas has contributed to the improvement of infrastructure. Transport and communication systems to and from source of natural gas areas have been improved. For example, the discovery and extraction of gas in Mtwara Region has stimulated improvement of the airport and the harbour in the region. As a result, air transport to and from Mtwara Region has also improved. Natural gas has also created the demand for labour, goods and services. There has been an increase in the demand for both skilled and unskilled labour to work in the mines and carry out mining-related activities. Moreover, natural gas extraction has added a source of income for the people. Companies involved in natural gas extraction usually pay taxes and other dues to the government. People living nearby natural gas extraction fields also benefit by selling goods,'

This does not include the refinement of these commodities. The mining industry contains five categories, which are defined by the resources they produce: oil and gas extraction, coal mining, metal ore mining, non-metallic mineral mining and quarrying, and support activities for mining.'
 '#### Oil and gas extraction industry:  \nThis industry is established to produce crude petroleum and natural gas; extract oil from sands and oil shale; produce natural gasoline and cycle condensate, and produce gas and hydrocarbon liquids from coal at the mine site. The petroleum and natural gas are used for various purposes including heating homes, fueling cars, powering factories, and serving as raw materials for plastics, chemicals, medicines, fertilizers, and synthetic fibers.'
 '#### Metal mining industry:  \nThe metal mining industry covers all industries established to engage in mining, developing mines, or exploring for metallic minerals (ores) primarily gold, silver, iron, lead, and zinc. The extracted minerals have a variety of industrial purposes: gold and silver are primarily used in jewelry and high-end electronics, iron is used to produce steel, copper is the main component of electrical wiring, lead is used in batteries, and zinc is used to coat iron and steel to reduce corrosion and as an alloy in the making of bronze and brass.'
 '#### Types of manufacturing industries in East Africa:  \nThere are different types of manufacturing industries in East Africa. They can be grouped as follows:\ni. Food and beverage industries\nii. Chemical industries\niii. Textile industries\niv. Mineral extraction industries\nv. Iron and steel industries: They make iron and steel bars, wires, and other iron and steel products.\nvi.

7,i need a define question about significance of renewable energies in USA for my students,Why is solar and wind energy considered important in the USA according to the textbook?,"['#### Importance of solar and wind energy in USA:  \nUSA finds it more economical to use solar and wind energy than other sources of energy as they have minimal environmental effects. Solar and wind energy in USA is important in so many ways.  \nEnvironmentally-friendly: The production of solar and wind energy involves activities which produce less waste in the environment compared to other sources of energy. These energies, therefore, are considered to be environmentally-friendly. For example, their production reduces the emission of carbon-dioxide and other pollutants.  \nCreation of employment opportunities: Installation and management of solar panels and wind mills require many employees. This industry generates jobs for thousands of people.'
 'Renewable energy sources: Renewable energy is any energy source that is naturally replaced. The energy can be derived from sunlight, tides, wind, water, geothermal, or hydroelectric action. Likewise, energy produced from the refining of various forms of biomass is often classified as renewable. The renewable energy sources are usually regarded as environmentally friendly because they release few chemicals that can harm the environment. These are energy resources that are naturally reused. Renewable sources are sustainable if they are carefully managed and maintained. They have minimal negative effects on the environment. Renewable energy sources include sunlight, geothermal heat, wind, tides, water, and various forms of biomass. Some of these energy sources are described in the following sub-sections.'
 '### Solar and wind energy harnessing in USA  \nUSA is one of the leading countries in the world harnessing energy from the Sun. Before 2008, much of the electricity was generated from other sources such as fossil fuel and HEP. By 2018, solar power accounted for 1.44 percent of the total USA electricity, generating about 58.9 terawatt-hours (TWH).  \nUSA needs energy that is secure, reliable, protective of the environment, and able to address climate change, create jobs and improve public health. USA reduced the use of fossil fuel as a source of energy because it is expensive and not renewable. The American Government reduces the cost of solar power and increases the cost of fossil fuel to encourage use of the former. USA, as a highly developed country in terms of technology and economy, has a very high demand for power and energy for industrial and domestic use.'
 'Renewable and non-renewable energy: Renewable energy is energy generated from sources that are essentially inexhaustible. Examples of renewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, geothermal energy, tidal power, and hydroelectric power. Non-renewable energy includes conventional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which are likely to get depleted with use.  \nConventional and non-conventional energy: Conventional energy is an energy source which is fixed in nature like oil, gas, coal, and hydropower generation. It is also termed as non-renewable energy or thermal energy. The conventional energy resources are being used extensively; as a result, their known reserves have been depleted to a great extent. The use of conventional energy has emerging effects on the environment. The non-conventional energy involves energy generated by wind, tides, solar and biomass. These are renewable sources of energy and not exhaustible.'
 'Industrial development: In USA, solar and wind energy have been found to be feasible sources of alternative energy for industrial development. The energy generated is considered cheaper than other available sources of energy such as fossil energy, HEP, natural gas, and nuclear energy.  \nExpansion of agriculture: Large-scale agriculture has been made possible by the availability of electricity from this source. The power is used in irrigation and processing of agricultural products.  \nAffordability: Solar and wind energy are relatively cheaper for many people in USA especially those who are unable to use other sources of electricity because it is subsidized by the government. This has improved their living standards.'

Natural gas is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, care has to be when extracting this resource. Natural gas production is new in Tanzania and, thus, it faces a shortage of skilled labour, especially in exploration and extraction activities. As a result, the government is often forced to employ foreign experts who are paid high salaries. Regarding the capacity to produce the natural gas, Tanzania has not been able to allocate enough funds for exploration, extraction, processing and distribution.'
 '#### Tanzania’s efforts in addressing the challenges of natural gas production  \nTanzania has been trying to overcome the challenges associated with the production of its natural gas. The government has been emphasising the use of revenue from natural gas to benefit the people in the areas producing the gas and the nation as a whole. The revenue from natural gas is used to improve social services in education and health. There have been various public programmes aimed to educate the public on natural gas benefits. The ministries responsible for energy and mineral resources in Tanzania conduct awareness creation programmes through various ways such as meetings and the media. The government also provides opportunities for training to Tanzanians in oil and natural gas. These training opportunities aim to build the country’s capacity for exploration, extraction, processing and supplying of natural gas.'

It also needs slight rainfall ranging from 650 mm to 1,500 mm. It is grown in well-drained loamy soil. This type of soil contains a lot of decayed vegetable matter with little amounts of sand and clay. Rainfall plays an important role as far as fibre production is concerned. On the whole, sisal does not need too much rainfall and cannot tolerate frosty conditions.'
 'Bulbils are initially grown in nurseries before being transplanted in double rows after a year. In the nursery, the bulbils should be planted in beds at 10 cm x 10 cm apart. It is recommended to use sisal waste for their growth. Thereafter, they are shifted to a second bed where they are planted at 30 cm x 30 cm apart. After 12 to 18 months, the young sisal plants are ready to be planted in the field. Unlike many other crops, sisal does not need much care. However, when it is planted on a previously used old land, it is important to use fertiliser. During the first two years it is important to control weeds by hand, machines or chemicals. Although the sisal plant is resistant to pests and diseases, it is important to control pests and diseases such as sisal weevil and bole rot. Growing sisal does not require irrigation as the sisal plant is drought-resistant and cultivated as a rain-fed crop.'
 '### Sisal  \nSisal is a tropical plant whose leaves produce strong threads (fibres) which are used for various purposes such as rope and carpet making. Sisal was originally grown in southern Mexico. Subsequently, it has been widely cultivated in many other countries. In fact, it has widely been introduced in the tropics and subtropics. In Tanzania, sisal was introduced in 1893 by Dr Richard Hindorf and the first 62 sisal plants were planted near Pangani in Tanga Region. Until the 1960s, Tanzania was the leading producer of sisal, but since then Brazil has become the major world producer of sisal, followed by Tanzania, Kenya, Madagascar and China. In Tanzania, sisal is grown in Tanga, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Morogoro, Lindi and Mtwara regions.  \nFigure 2.7 Sisal farm in Tanga  \nSource: https://www.ippmedia.com/en/news/strategising-restore-sisal-cash-crop-day'
 '#### Farm preparation, planting and caring of sisal:  \nIt is recommended that land should be well-prepared by ploughing to a depth of 30 cm before planting.'
 '#### Harvesting, processing and transportation of sisal:  \nHarvesting of sisal begins when the colour of thorns at the tips changes from dark brown to light-brown. The processing of leaves should take place 48 hours after being harvested. Through processing, sisal fibres are obtained whereby the leaves are crushed between rollers and then mechanically scraped. Then the fibres are washed and dried. Drying of fibres is done in the sun or by using drying machines. This is followed by brushing of the dried fibres for straightening as well as polishing. Thereafter, the fibres are graded depending on their length and colour. It is important to ensure cleanliness of the bale. Graded fibres are then packed into bales either manually or by using machines.'

 '##### Harvesting, processing, and transportation of wheat:  \nIn the process of harvesting, there is a need to test the crop. In this regard, fingers are used to rub the wheat head and pieces of grain are chewed. If the grains crack in the mouth and become soft as they are chewed, then they are ready for harvesting. Clean places are prepared for keeping the harvested wheat. When using a sickle for harvesting, it should be checked to make sure it is sharp enough for making clean cuts. In commercial farming, Rice the combine harvester is adjusted to harvest the wheat. Harvesting is done when the crop reaches maturity (at least 100 days). The part that is harvested is called kernels. Freshly harvested wheat is taken to a local grain elevator as soon as possible after harvest.'
 '#### Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation:  \nHarvesting of coffee berries is done by hand. Only the red ripe berries are picked. Berries are dried in the sun and then are sorted, weighed and transported to the processing mills. Since coffee can easily absorb external odours which can affect its quality, it must be stored in cool, dark, and dry places to ensure freshness.'

Human beings do such activities for social, economic, and political purposes. In this chapter, you will learn about human activities, types of human activities, and the importance of such activities.'
 '### Importance of human activities  \nHuman activities are important in many ways. People are employed in different sectors depending on the kind of activities they can do. For example, in mining there are multi-national companies such as Williamson Diamonds and Barrick Gold (now known as Acacia), which employ many people. The companies also pay tax to the government. Moreover, employment in different human activities generate income which improves people’s standards of living.'
 '### The concept of human activities  \nHuman activities are functions, tasks or works that human beings perform to earn a living. Different individuals or groups of people carry out different activities in different places. For example, the Maasai of Tanzania and Kenya practise nomadic pastoralism because of seasonal availability of pasture and water in an area. People in urban areas, on the other hand, engage in activities in industries and offices. Some people engage in providing services in education, administration, planning, and health.'

12,Need a long explanation question about ocean water for Form 2 Geography.,Explain how the increase in temperature affects the rate of evaporation from ocean water.,"['### The concept of water management  \nWater is a colourless liquid found naturally on the land surface, atmosphere, and underground reservoirs. Water can exist in liquid, solid, or gas state. Although water is a familiar substance, it is also a unique material of the earth. For a long time, water has been considered to be an abundant resource which is found freely to all people. Today, most countries are facing increasing pressure on water resources and growing competition between differing interests. Chronic water scarcity is perceived to be one of the threats to global prosperity and stability. Other threats include hydrological uncertainty and extreme weather disasters such as floods and droughts.'
 '#### Temperature:  \nAn increase in temperature accelerates the rate of evaporation. During the warm season, plants open their stomata (pores) and release water in the form of water vapour. During the cold season, plants close their stomata and prohibit the release of water. 10% of the moisture in the atmosphere is contributed by the release of water from plants.  \nFigure 3.2: Evaporation from ocean water  \nFigure 3.3: Evapotranspiration'
 '#### Problems resulting from the extraction of water resources  \nDifferent methods used in harnessing water resources have resulted in both social and environmental impacts as explained below.  \n(i) Pollution of marine water is one of the impacts the world is facing as a result of poor and bad methods of exploiting water resources. Polluted water affects marine animals such as fish and planktons.\n(ii) Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has resulted in some fish species disappearing.\n(iii) Poor methods of quarrying for building materials has led to further land degradation of shores in addition to the destruction of fish breeding areas and coral reefs.\n(iv) Excessive exploitation of marine life does not only lead to loss of life but also reduces the amount of fish, cuts down breeding capacity and replacement capacity of other species.\n(v) Pollution of water, apart from affecting the life of fish, may also damage the near shore marine environment.'
 '- Strait of Malacca: This is the shortest route between the Pacific and Indian oceans. It links major Asian economies such as India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Japan, China, South Korea and Taiwan. The Strait of Malacca is the world’s second busiest water way with more than 83,000 vessels taking this route each year. Goods transported through this strait include coal, palm oil, Indonesian coffee and liquefied natural gas. The Malacca water ways connect the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea (Pacific Ocean).'
 '#### Surface water:  \nSurface water is water that exists in streams and lakes. This water is primarily used for potable water supply, recreation, irrigation, industry, livestock, transportation, and hydroelectric energy. Over 63 percent of the public water supply is withdrawn from surface water. Irrigation gets 58 percent of its water supply from surface water. Industry gets almost 98 percent of its water from surface water systems. Small amounts may come from small channels.  \nSome springs release hot water, hence the name ""hot springs"".

Discuss how their role contributes to the conservation of wildlife in Tanzania.,"['#### Management of national parks and game reserves in Tanzania:  \nNational parks in Tanzania are managed by the Tanzania National Parks Authority (TANAPA). This authority is responsible for the management and regulation of the use of all areas designated as national parks. The Tanzania Wildlife Authority (TAWA) is responsible for the management and regulation of the use of all the areas designated as game reserves and all wildlife outside national parks and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA). The NCA is managed by the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA). This is the only conservation area in Tanzania where humans, livestock and wildlife share the same environment (multiple use area).'
 'National parks are areas created and protected by law for the purpose of conservation of wildlife and its associated habitat. Examples of National Parks in Tanzania include Serengeti, Mikumi, Lake Manyara, Ruaha, Gombe, Mahale, Katavi, Kitulo, Saadani, Kilimanjaro, Mkomazi, Saanane Island, Rubondo, Nyerere National Park at Selous (the upper part of Selous), Udzungwa, and Tarangire. Game reserves include the lower part of Selous (which is the largest protected area in Tanzania), Rukwa, Ugalla, and Maswa. Ngorongoro conservation area is the only protected area in Tanzania where humans, livestock, and wildlife live together in the same environment.  \nTourism industry creates employment and stimulates the growth of service sectors such as transport, hospitality, insurance, communications, and tour guiding. Figure 1.6 shows tourists in a car observing lions, one of the wildlife attractions.  \n| Figure 1.6 | Tourists observe lions at Tarangire National Park                             |'
 '- Involving the local communities: Involvement of local communities will promote a sustainable tourism industry. Indeed, protection of national parks and game reserves needs the commitment of the people living near the parks and game reserves. Moreover, communities should enjoy the benefits obtained from the use of protected areas by tourists.\n- Promotion of domestic tourism: Domestic tourism is not well-developed in Tanzania because of the high costs and lack of touring interest among natives. Therefore, domestic tourism should be promoted by offering affordable rates to natives. Also, eco-tourism should be established.\n- Lessons drawn to promote the tourism industry in Tanzania: The following are some of the lessons that can be drawn from focal studies discussed in relation to promoting the tourism industry in Tanzania.'
 'The country is gifted with unique and diverse natural and cultural tourist attractions such as national parks, game reserves with many species of wildlife, conserved areas, lakes, large plateaux, several marine parks, cultural heritage sites and several historical sites. Some of the National Parks include Serengeti, Ruaha, Mikumi, Lake Manyara, Katavi, Tarangire, Bugiri-Chato, Udzungwa Mountains and Saadani. Some of the game reserves include the lower part of Selous, Rukwa, Maswa, Mpanga-Kipengere and SwagaSwaga. Figure 6.6 is a map of Tanzania showing major tourist sites. Tourism in Tanzania is also marked by Mount Kilimanjaro (Figure 6.5) which is a National Park.  \nFigure 6.5 Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania\nSource: https://www.tanzaniatourism.go.tz  \nFigure 6.6 Major tourist sites in Tanzania'
 'Increase in population for settlement and agriculture expansion has led to encroachment on national parks and game reserves. This has led to degradation of wildlife areas, threatening their existence. In addition, crime and violent activities in some areas will discourage tourists from visiting such areas.  \n##### Promoting tourism in Tanzania:  \nThe following are the ways that can be used to promote tourism in Tanzania:  \n- Marketing strategies and publicity: Marketing of the tourism sector both domestically and internationally should be enhanced. There is a need for the government and other players in the industry to market aggressively the country’s tourist attractions in international media and forums.'

14,"good morning, can you make a long question on Cons of nomadic pastoralism where students explain in detail",Explain in detail the disadvantages of nomadic pastoralism as outlined in the Geography textbook for Form Two students. Include at least three specific drawbacks and provide explanations for each.,"['Nomadic pastoralism involves continual movement of pastoralists with large numbers of animals from place to place in search of pasture and water. People involved in this practice are called nomads or pastoralists. Tribes which practise nomadic pastoralism include the Maasai, Barbaig, Kwavi, and Karamajong. Nomadic pastoralism is mostly practised in sparsely populated areas where the natural vegetation is mainly grass and bushes and, sometimes, scattered trees. In these areas, rainfall is very low and unreliable. The pastoralists follow specific routes in their movements. Figure 2.10 shows a large herd of cattle. The animals kept by pastoralists are a source of food and income through the selling of animals and their products. Major products from animals are meat and milk. The pastoralists spend the money they earn to meet family needs such as buying cereals, paying school fees, and meeting health expenses. In addition, the cattle raised are used for paying bride price and giving gifts'
 '#### Characteristics of nomadic pastoralism:  \nThe nomads normally move in groups. These groups are formed through the integration of families or members of a given ethnic group. A group involves a chief or elders who make decisions for the entire group. Indeed, large herd tends to cause overgrazing. Overgrazing is a situation where the number of cattle is greater than the carrying capacity of the grazing land. As a result, overgrazing causes soil erosion, land degradation, and loss of valuable species. Another feature of the nomadic pastoralists is the breeding process, which is uncontrolled. This situation may lead to the spread and outbreak of animal diseases, hence low animal quality and deaths.  \nIn addition, there is poor control of pests and other diseases, which result to poor quality of animal products. Furthermore, nomadic pastoralism takes place where the population is scarce as the animals are grazed in open range, which needs a lot of space.'
 '#### Disadvantages of nomadic pastoralism:  \nNomadic pastoralism suffers from lack of processing and storage facilities, hence causing a significant loss of the products. Also, over-grazing under nomadic pastoralism leads to soil erosion. Moreover, the control of diseases is difficult since animals are always on the move, which can affect the health of the animals and lower productivity in the process. For example, there have been cases of loss of large numbers of livestock due to lack of water and pasture. This situation affects the economy of the pastoralists. Furthermore, the practise of nomadic pastoralism tends to cause conflicts as they interfere with crop cultivators’ land. Because of their nomadic nature, many of the pastoralists’ children fail to attend formal education. As such, their periodic movements result in many of these children being denied their right to education and associated opportunities.'
 'In addition, low capital investment limits the development of the livestock- keeping sector in the country. Also, inadequate land for grazing leads to conflicts between farmers and pastoralists. Nomadic pastoralists, for example, always move from one place to another in search of pasture and water. As a result, they sometimes graze on the farms, hence conflicts arise between them and farmers. With nomadic pastoralism, the animals get tired due to long distances over which they move. Sometimes, the animals get sick and die, thus leading to low production in terms of quality and quantity.  \n##### Ways of solving challenges facing livestock-keeping in Tanzania:'

Numerous economic activities are conducted in water while others use water as part of raw material.  \nHuman beings are primary users of water and integrate it in their economic activities in various ways. Their ability to plan and conduct economic activities is basically supported by water. Water is used as an important ingredient in sustaining life, especially for cooking, drinking and maintaining cleanliness. Generally, water is essential for economic development. It is used in the manufacturing industry, hydro-electric power generation, and navigation as well as domestic activities and trade.'
 'Other uses of water which contribute to economic growth and prosperity are tourism and sports. Some water sceneries attract local and foreign tourists which helps to earn income for the host countries. Water-based sports such as skiing, surfing, canoeing and diving are also sources of income.'
 '## Chapter Three (Water management for economic development)  \n### Introduction  \nIn this chapter, you will learn about the uses and economic importance of water; the relationship between family size, water supply, and the quality of life; the relationship between vegetation and water supply; and the effects of distance to water sources from households to a girl child in Tanzania. You will also learn about river basin development, requirements for establishing a river basin project, as well as benefits and challenges facing river basin projects. Finally, you will learn about land reclamation, underground water, aquatic resources, pollution, and water conservation.'
 'Moreover, water is used in various processing and manufacturing industries for the production of food and beverages. It is important in mixing ingredients that are added to raw materials during food and beverage processing and production. For example, water is a component of most beverages such as soft drinks, milk, coffee and tea. These beverages contribute to the economy of many countries as a source of income generation. They are sold locally and exported to earn foreign income. Other industrial uses of water include cooling and washing.'
 'Water resource management refers to the process of planning, developing, distributing and managing the effective use of water resources. In today’s interconnected world, there is no doubt about the value of integrated planning for sustainable development. There is a need to have an integrated water resources management that supports the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. Integrated Water Resources Management is one of the initiatives for sustainable use of water resources, and it refers to a process of promoting the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources, in order to maximise the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems.

It is one of the sectors which employs people and serves as a source of government revenue. Commercial livestock-keeping provides food products such as meat and milk consumed by households and industries. Moreover, it contributes to the production of goods such as shoes, bags, and animal foods. The benefits of commercial livestock-keeping include the ability to utilize breeds that can enhance reproductive performance. This practice also stimulates the development of transport and communication. Commercial livestock-keeping also facilitates the control of diseases and pests because it limits animal movement. It also uses high technology and scientific methods in management.'

They can also stay for a long time without water.\n- Likewise, the cattle are cheap to manage in terms of shelter.'
 '##### Advantages of sedentary livestock-keeping:  \nThe size of the livestock makes it easy to control diseases since livestock- keepers use modern methods of treatment. Sedentary livestock-keeping also takes place in places where the population prevents the movement of animals from one place to another in search of food and water. Keeping animals in barns also enables the keepers to engage in other economic activities such as trade. Sedentary livestock-keeping can either be for food or commercial purposes.  \n##### Disadvantages of sedentary livestock-keeping:  \nDespite the advantages sedentary livestock-keeping presents, it is labour-intensive and can be time- consuming. It is also expensive in terms of building barns, feeding and taking care of the animals. In fact, livestock- keepers under the sedentary system sometimes have to deal with scarcity of animal feeds. This shortage may lower productivity particularly due to change of weather conditions such as prolonged drought.'
 '#### Benefits of livestock-keeping:  \nLivestock-keeping stimulates the growth of industries that process different animal-related products such as hides, horns, and hooves as raw materials. It is also a source of income by selling animals and their products. In addition, livestock-keeping provides employment to people, which helps to improve their living conditions. Moreover, livestock-keeping contributes to government revenue.'
 ""### Livestock-keeping  \nLivestock-keeping is the rearing of animals and poultry for food and commercial purposes. The word 'livestock' applies primarily to cattle or dairy cows, goats, pigs, camels, horses, mules, poultry, and sheep.

These are primary, secondary, and tertiary activities.'
 '## Chapter One (Human Activities)  \n### Introduction  \nHuman activities refer to things that people do or cause to happen. Human beings do such activities for social, economic, and political purposes. In this chapter, you will learn about human activities, types of human activities, and the importance of such activities.'
 '### The concept of human activities  \nHuman activities are functions, tasks or works that human beings perform to earn a living. Different individuals or groups of people carry out different activities in different places. For example, the Maasai of Tanzania and Kenya practise nomadic pastoralism because of seasonal availability of pasture and water in an area. People in urban areas, on the other hand, engage in activities in industries and offices. Some people engage in providing services in education, administration, planning, and health.'
 '### Importance of human activities  \nHuman activities are important in many ways. People are employed in different sectors depending on the kind of activities they can do. For example, in mining there are multi-national companies such as Williamson Diamonds and Barrick Gold (now known as Acacia), which employ many people. The companies also pay tax to the government. Moreover, employment in different human activities generate income which improves people’s standards of living.'
 '#### Primary activities:  \nPrimary activities are done by people when they interact directly with the natural environment to obtain their essential needs. These activities include agriculture, forestry, mining, and fishing.  \n##### Agriculture:  \nAgriculture is an activity which involves crop cultivation and livestock-keeping. It is the oldest human activity which has been practised by all societies in the world. It provides food for households and raw materials for industries. The type of agriculture practised in a given place is determined by various conditions of the area including climate, water availability, soil characteristics and terrain. It is also influenced by financial resources, infrastructure, technology and conditions of the market.'

18,"hey buddy, can you help me to create a description question on the benefits of commercial livestock farming that I can use for the class?",Describe three benefits of commercial livestock-keeping mentioned in the textbook excerpt.,"['#### Advantages of commercial livestock-keeping:  \nCommercial livestock-keeping acts as a source of raw materials for industries such as food processing, shoe, and cloth making. It is one of the sectors which employs people and serves as a source of government revenue. Commercial livestock-keeping provides food products such as meat and milk consumed by households and industries. Moreover, it contributes to the production of goods such as shoes, bags, and animal foods. The benefits of commercial livestock-keeping include the ability to utilize breeds that can enhance reproductive performance. This practice also stimulates the development of transport and communication. Commercial livestock-keeping also facilitates the control of diseases and pests because it limits animal movement. It also uses high technology and scientific methods in management.'
 '#### Disadvantages of commercial livestock-keeping:  \nDespite the advantages, commercial livestock-keeping is costly in establishing, operation, and maintenance. Moreover, it uses many resources mainly human and physical in the production process. Furthermore, commercial livestock-keeping needs large sparsely populated areas. If animal wastes and discards are not properly treated, they can cause water, land, and air pollution, and diseases.'
 '### Commercial livestock-keeping  \nCommercial livestock-keeping involves rearing of animals for the purpose of selling their products such as meat, milk, wool and hides. Ranching, as part of commercial livestock-keeping, is mostly practised in more remote areas where land is extensive and population density is low. Extensive land provides sufficient grass to support a large number of animals. Commercial livestock-keeping is determined by factors such as capital, level of technology, market, availability of pasture and climatic conditions. In temperate regions, supplementary food such as hay and root crops are used to feed them during winter. Animals are kept for meat (beef cattle), for milk (dairy cattle and camel) and for wool (sheep).'
 '#### Characteristics of commercial livestock-keeping  \nCommercial livestock-keeping takes place on a large area with low population density. More space is needed for the construction of ranches and growing grass for feeding livestock. Generally, commercial livestock-keeping is practiced in more remote areas where other forms of land use are limited. Usually, one type of animal is kept for quality control of products. In addition, commercial livestock-keeping is capital-intensive as it demands money for buying land, paying for labor, fencing, and buying machines and equipment. Furthermore, crossbreeding in commercial livestock-keeping is an important management practice.'
 '#### Benefits of livestock-keeping:  \nLivestock-keeping stimulates the growth of industries that process different animal-related products such as hides, horns, and hooves as raw materials. It is also a source of income by selling animals and their products. In addition, livestock-keeping provides employment to people, which helps to improve their living conditions.

19,"good morning, can you make a true or false question about post-harvest processing of tea?",True or False: The processing of tea leaves involves fermenting them under regulated moisture conditions to ensure a quality tea product.,"['#### Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation of tea:  \nIt takes two years for tea plants to be ready for harvesting. Picking of tea leaves requires experience because if it is done poorly, it may result in low-quality tea. Tea plants are normally plucked for 3-4 years after which all old branches are pruned for new shoots to grow. The plucked tea leaves undergo fermentation under regulated moisture to ensure quality tea product. Thereafter, tea leaves are rolled to enhance the breakup of the leaf cells and fibres. The leaves are then dried in temperatures of about 105°C. This process is called roasting or firing. Roasting stops fermentation and reduces moisture. Cool and dried tea is sorted in different sizes and graded. Unwanted particles are removed before packing. At this stage, tea is ready for consumption and export.

 '#### Farm preparation, planting and caring of tea:  \nFarms for tea growing are prepared by clearing land. The ideal row spacing for tea plantation is 100 – 110 cm with the plant spacing of 65 – 75 cm. This spacing makes it possible to plant 15,000 plants in an acre.  \nTea also needs full shade and protection from other previously planted trees. The trees protect the plants from being affected by wind. In other words, they act as a wind breaker. Tea production is a labour-intensive activity because planting, weeding, picking and processing largely depend on human labour.'
 '#### Harvesting, processing and transportation of sisal:  \nHarvesting of sisal begins when the colour of thorns at the tips changes from dark brown to light-brown. The processing of leaves should take place 48 hours after being harvested. Through processing, sisal fibres are obtained whereby the leaves are crushed between rollers and then mechanically scraped. Then the fibres are washed and dried. Drying of fibres is done in the sun or by using drying machines. This is followed by brushing of the dried fibres for straightening as well as polishing. Thereafter, the fibres are graded depending on their length and colour. It is important to ensure cleanliness of the bale. Graded fibres are then packed into bales either manually or by using machines.'
 '### Tea:  \nTea is a plant whose leaves are used for making a beverage. In Tanzania, tea is mainly grown in Mbeya, Iringa, Njombe, Kagera, Kilimanjaro, and Tanga regions. Other major tea growing countries in the world are Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, China, Sri-Lanka, India, Indonesia, and Argentina.'
 '##### Harvesting, processing, and transportation of wheat:  \nIn the process of harvesting, there is a need to test the crop. In this regard, fingers are used to rub the wheat head and pieces of grain are chewed. If the grains crack in the mouth and become soft as they are chewed, then they are ready for harvesting. Clean places are prepared for keeping the harvested wheat. When using a sickle for harvesting, it should be checked to make sure it is sharp enough for making clean cuts. In commercial farming, Rice the combine harvester is adjusted to harvest the wheat. Harvesting is done when the crop reaches maturity (at least 100 days). The part that is harvested is called kernels. Freshly harvested wheat is taken to a local grain elevator as soon as possible after harvest.'

These factors are features that encourage tourists to visit places for leisure, pleasure or education.  \n- Tourist attractions: Tourist attractions include places with pleasant climate, beautiful and varied sceneries, different cultures, historical sites and monuments. Also, some features in Tanzania such as Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest free-standing mountain in the world, attract tourists.\n- Advancement in communication and transportation network: Reliable communication network and advanced technology encourage the development of tourism in a country. For example, the use of the internet, television programmes, and social media, tourism trade fair and exhibitions has facilitated availability of information on tourism, hence it has led to an influx of tourists.'
 'Furthermore, tourism contributes to the expansion of infrastructure throughout the country.\nRevenue collected from the tourism industry finances the expansion of roads and other related sectors such as education and health.\nTourism also contributes to the earnings of foreign currency which facilitate the country’s economic growth. Both domestic and international tourism are sources of foreign currency.'
 'Many people have secured jobs in the tourism industry, for example, hotel staff, tour guides and drivers. Others are employed in the local handicrafts industry such as wood carving from Okavango and Caprivi and basketry from Himba. The tourist industry also contributes to the earning of a lot of foreign currency; for example, earnings from travel agencies, hotels and restaurants, entertainment groups and shops, as well as the National Reserve. The transport and communication network around tourist attractions have also been improved. This has benefited both the tourism industry and local communities. The provision of education, health services, water supply and electricity have improved as a result of the development of the tourism industry. This has, in turn, contributed to improvement of the standard of living of the people. Furthermore, tourism contributes to the growth of GDP, hence making it a valuable sector within the country. Tourism is a major industry contributing Namibian'
 'Access to water is fundamental to economic and social development. However, population growth, rapid urbanisation and industrialisation, the expansion of agriculture and tourism, and climate change all put water under increasing stress. This situation has impacted negatively the socio-economic development of most developing countries. As a result, at the global level, there is a major concern regarding the management of water resources. Water resources management emerged as a response to real and foreseen water crises and increasingly unsustainable pressure on the freshwater resources, which emanate from rising populations, growing demands for water due to competing water uses, and increasing pollution.'
 '#### Positive impact of tourism:  \nThe tourism sector has the following positive impact on society. The development and expansion of international tourism has led to the creation of various job opportunities. Similarly, the tourism industry has led to job creation in rural areas, thereby reducing levels of rural-urban migration. An example can be cited from the area around Mount Kilimanjaro and Arusha in Tanzania where people secure jobs as porters, translators and guides on a sustainable basis.  \nAs a result, both skilled and unskilled personnel find employment in the sector as well as the hospitality industry; hence they improve their standards of living.'

Besides, you will learn about the production of cars in Japan, electronic devices in South Korea and textiles in Tanzania.'
 '### The concept of manufacturing industry  \nThe manufacturing industry involves the processing and changing of raw materials into different semi-finished or finished products using tools and machines. It plays a major role in bringing about the development of a country. The ever-growing population with increased demands for goods and services is accommodated by the establishment of manufacturing industries. Such increased population demands more food, shelter, clothes and other services. The following section explains the importance of manufacturing industries in the world.'
 '#### Industrial pollution:  \nThe manufacturing process turns raw materials into useful goods. But some of the by-products of manufacturing waste materials left over or substances produced by the manufacturing process itself, may be harmful to the environment. Manufacturing contributes to air and water pollution for example the Wazo Hill Cement industry in Dar es Salaam.'
 '### The importance of manufacturing industries:  \n- (a) Manufacturing industries are sources of employment for both skilled and unskilled labour. These employees can raise their standards of living and improve quality of life with the income they earn. The income they earn caters for basic needs such as food, shelter, clothes and education.\n- (b) Manufacturing industries also lead to the diversification of the country’s economy due to their potentials for promoting other sectors of the economy. This reduces over-dependence on one or two economic sectors, which can be affected by fluctuation of prices in the world market.\n- (c) Manufacturing industries enable countries to process locally produced raw materials before they are exported.

22,Provide a true or false statement on Traditional fallowing techniques to test form 2 students,"True or False: Bush fallowing involves clearing the bush, burning the vegetation, and sowing seeds, and the farm is left to regain its fertility for nearly ten years.","['Small-scale crop cultivation is done by using different methods such as shifting cultivation, crop rotation, and bush fallowing.'
 '#### Bush fallowing:  \nBush fallowing is not different from shifting cultivation in that in bush fallowing people have permanent settlements. They clear the bush, burn the vegetation, and sow seeds. Yield declines after three to five years. The farm is left to regain its fertility for nearly ten years. Another bush is cleared and cultivated. No movement is involved in bush fallowing. This is possible in areas with dense population. Small-scale crop cultivation is advantageous to farmers. It allows them to grow varieties of food crops. Different crops grown in small farms make it easy to control pests and diseases. Elementary tools such as pangas, hand hoes and axes lead to low cost of running the farms, hence low capital involved. Farmers depend on rainfall only which is unreliable hence, during droughts the farmers suffer from famine.'
 'This is a traditional system of cultivation used in tropical rainforest and miombo wooded savanna. It operates where the population is sparse. People farm and move to another fresh area when the yields are low. The cultivator or farmer burns the forest and sows seeds in the intermixed ash and soil. Little attention is given to the crops until they ripen. If the harvest declines, the land is abandoned, and a fresh area is cleared. The yields decline after three to five years. The cultivator may return to the original land after some years. The constant moves ensure fresh land with high yields, as the land is fertile. There is no serious soil erosion since only a small area is exposed which supports many crops and therefore little bare earth is seen. Any soil washed is trapped by dense plant roots and at the forest edge. The system is less risky of diseases. The methods used in shifting cultivation differ with people’s culture and the varieties of crops they grow. Some use fire to clear'
 'Also, the remains of forest trees including foliage contribute to soil development through decomposition into organic matter, leading to formation of humus. Soil in the forest is very fertile due to humus from decomposed plant remains. Solar energy helps plants to manufacture their own food through photosynthesis. Plants are eaten by herbivores; likewise, herbivores are consumed by carnivores who feed on meat. When they all die, their remains are decomposed by bacteria which break down dead matter and release nutrients into the soil. Therefore, forests have input in the food chain. Tree canopies control the evaporation of water from the soil beneath, hence allow more retention of water in the soil. The canopies also enable recharging of ground water by controlling over land flow after rainfall. In addition, forest trees contribute to water vapour in the atmosphere which is important in regulating atmospheric conditions. The humidity in the atmosphere is important in the rain formation'
 '#### Disadvantages of small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop cultivation is associated with loss of soil fertility due to overuse of the same plots of land. Moreover, the practice of burning vegetation during farm preparation tends to destroy soil nutrients, hence lower its fertility. As a result, subsistence or peasant farmers’ yields tend to fall. Such low yields are also contributed by low use of fertilisers and pesticides. Therefore, various ways are needed to reduce the challenges of small-scale crop cultivation.'

Sustainable use of water resources includes all activities relating to current and future use of water resources in terms of protection, conservation, and management. There are surface and underground water sources.'
 '#### Underground water:  \nThis is the most plentiful of all freshwater resources. As water percolates into the ground through layers of soil, clay, and rock, some of it adheres to the topmost layers to support plant growth. Most often, groundwater is accessed by humans via wells. To build a well, one must drill down past the water table. In most cases, a pump is placed at the bottom of the well, and water is pumped into homes, businesses, and water treatment plants, where it is then distributed for usage.'
 '#### Infiltration:  \nInfiltration, which is sometimes called percolation, is the process whereby water that has reached the ground penetrates into the soil or rocks (Figure 3.6).  \nSome of the water may seep through and go deep underground and create underground runoff or aquifer in the rocks. Water that percolates the land surface is called underground water. Infiltration is an essential process as it feeds water bodies and soils which are sources of evaporation and evapotranspiration.'
 'This way of waste disposal contaminates shallow wells which may cause water-borne diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea and typhoid. Shallow wells are mostly the source of water for domestic use in many communities, especially those which have no formal water supply from authorised dealers.  \nTransportation and storage of materials which may spill and leak is another source of underground water pollution. For example, chemicals used in manufacturing, processing and construction industries sometimes are not transported and stored by observing any specified handling precautions. This leads to spillage and leakage to the ground and, consequently, seepage into the soil which pollutes underground water through infiltration.'
 'Water resource management refers to the process of planning, developing, distributing and managing the effective use of water resources. In today’s interconnected world, there is no doubt about the value of integrated planning for sustainable development. There is a need to have an integrated water resources management that supports the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. Integrated Water Resources Management is one of the initiatives for sustainable use of water resources, and it refers to a process of promoting the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources, in order to maximise the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems. The management helps to protect the environment, foster economic growth and sustainable agricultural development, promote democratic participation in governance, and improve human health.'

 '##### Harvesting, processing, and transportation of wheat:  \nIn the process of harvesting, there is a need to test the crop. In this regard, fingers are used to rub the wheat head and pieces of grain are chewed. If the grains crack in the mouth and become soft as they are chewed, then they are ready for harvesting. Clean places are prepared for keeping the harvested wheat. When using a sickle for harvesting, it should be checked to make sure it is sharp enough for making clean cuts. In commercial farming, Rice the combine harvester is adjusted to harvest the wheat. Harvesting is done when the crop reaches maturity (at least 100 days). The part that is harvested is called kernels. Freshly harvested wheat is taken to a local grain elevator as soon as possible after harvest.'

29,I need a describe question about evaporation for form two students,Describe the process of evaporation and explain what factors influence the rate of evaporation.,"['### Evaporation  \nEvaporation is the process by which water changes from liquid to gas or vapour. During evaporation, water moves into the atmosphere in the form of water vapour or moisture. Water bodies such as rivers, lakes, seas, and oceans contribute about 90% of the moisture found in the atmosphere through evaporation. Water changes into vapour under the great influence of temperature. Areas with high temperatures and low humidity experience a high rate of evaporation. Evaporation is also determined by humidity and wind.'
 '### Evapotranspiration  \nEvapotranspiration refers to the process whereby water is transferred from the land to the air through plant roots and leaves. Water from the land is carried by roots to the leaves, a process known as transpiration, and then from the leaves it changes into vapour and moves into the atmosphere through the process of evaporation. The combination of these two processes form what is termed as evapotranspiration (Evaporation + transpiration = evapotranspiration). Evapotranspiration is determined by factors such as temperature, humidity, wind, soil, and type of plants. These factors are hereby explained.'
 '#### Temperature:  \nAn increase in temperature accelerates the rate of evaporation. During the warm season, plants open their stomata (pores) and release water in the form of water vapour. During the cold season, plants close their stomata and prohibit the release of water. 10% of the moisture in the atmosphere is contributed by the release of water from plants.  \nFigure 3.2: Evaporation from ocean water  \nFigure 3.3: Evapotranspiration'
 '### Condensation  \nCondensation is the process whereby water in its gaseous form changes into liquid. The moist warm air from water bodies and plants moves upwards where there is very low temperature. Then it reaches a dew point (point at which water condenses) and forms clouds. Clouds are masses of water droplets which continue to accumulate and when they are saturated, they become dense and fall as rain. Condensation is a very essential process in the hydrological cycle because it leads to the formation of clouds which produce rainfall (Figure 3.4). Rainfall is the main route through which water returns to the earth’s surface.  \nFigure 3.4 Heavy clouds in the air\nSource: ruvumapress.blogspot.com-mawingu mazito'
 '### Precipitation  \nPrecipitation is the falling of water from the clouds in form of rain, snow, sleet or hail. Figure 3.5 shows different forms of precipitation. It is the last stage that demonstrates the return of water to the earth’s surface after changing into a gaseous form. Precipitation may be heavy or light thereby creating heavy rain, snow or hail. Whereas rain is directly in liquid form, snow and hail are water in solid form as a result of freezing. Water reaches the ground in form of snow or hail after the temperature in the atmosphere fails to melt it completely before reaching the ground. Upon reaching the ground, which has higher temperature than the atmosphere, the snow and hail melt into liquid as surface run-off. Also some water infiltrates into the earth’s surface through soil and cracks.  \nFigure 3.5 Different forms of precipitation\nSource: pinterest.com-forms of precipitation'

Some of these are described below.  \n- Drought: Prolonged droughts decrease the volume of water, which in turn reduces the ability of hydro-electric power plants to produce electricity.\n- Inadequate capital: The construction of dams and hydro-electric power stations requires heavy capital outlays. Capital is also essential in the production and transportation of natural gas. Unfortunately, many developing countries lack capital to harness fossil fuel and hydropower potentials.\n- Transport and communication networks: These are inadequate in many developing countries, which hinders the extraction or transmission of energy and power.\n- Poor technology and lack of skilled personnel: Some energy and power production systems such as nuclear, tidal, and geothermal energy require advanced technology, which is lacking in most developing countries.'
 '### Addressing the challenges of energy and power production:  \nDifferent measures can be taken to address power challenges and energy production challenges, they include the following:  \n- Desilting of dams: Regular removal of silt (desilting) from the dams is recommended to maintain the necessary depth for power generation. If desilting is ignored, the decreased depth of dams may affect the production of HEP since the storage capacity of the dam is severely reduced.\n- Alternative energy sources: Alternative sources of energy such as solar energy should be used to reduce the effect of pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels and fuelwood.\n- Environmental conservation projects: The establishment of power and energy production projects should go hand in hand with environmental conservation projects such as afforestation, reforestation, and proper waste management.'
 'Nuclear energy: Nuclear energy is derived from atoms by altering or breaking their structure. Alteration of the structure of the atom leads to a release of energy in the form of heat. Released energy is used to generate electricity. An important raw material for this process is uranium. Although nuclear energy itself is a renewable energy source, the material used in nuclear plants is not renewable. Nuclear power is mostly generated in USA, France, Russia, China, India, Canada, Israel and UK. Nuclear power plants do not produce or emit greenhouse gases. They can be built in both rural and urban areas, and do not destroy the surrounding environment. However, nuclear energy is difficult to harvest and nuclear plants are very complicated to build and run. Likewise, in many communities there is limited capacity to develop a safe and reliable nuclear energy programme. Nuclear energy also produces radioactive materials, which increase health risks in the communities where the plants are'
 '### The concept of Power and Energy  \nPower: Power is the flow of energy at any one time, and can be generated from renewable energy resources through solar conversion (solar, thermal electricity, solar heating); harnessing water (hydropower for electricity, wave and tidal generation through turbines); harnessing the wind (wind pumps for water, wind turbines for electricity); and a variety of other energy sources. The main power sources are petroleum (oil), natural gas, water, coal and nuclear. Other sources include the earth’s interior (hot springs), wind, sun, tides, and waves, wood, peat and cattle or cow dung (biogas).'
 'Renewable and non-renewable energy: Renewable energy is energy generated from sources that are essentially inexhaustible. Examples of renewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, geothermal energy, tidal power, and hydroelectric power. Non-renewable energy includes conventional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which are likely to get depleted with use.  \nConventional and non-conventional energy: Conventional energy is an energy source which is fixed in nature like oil, gas, coal, and hydropower generation. It is also termed as non-renewable energy or thermal energy. The conventional energy resources are being used extensively; as a result, their known reserves have been depleted to a great extent. The use of conventional energy has emerging effects on the environment. The non-conventional energy involves energy generated by wind, tides, solar and biomass. These are renewable sources of energy and not exhaustible.'

32,"hi, can you bring me a define question on drawbacks of commercial livestock farming for my class?",What are the drawbacks of commercial livestock-keeping according to the information provided in the textbook?,"['#### Disadvantages of commercial livestock-keeping:  \nDespite the advantages, commercial livestock-keeping is costly in establishing, operation, and maintenance. Moreover, it uses many resources mainly human and physical in the production process. Furthermore, commercial livestock-keeping needs large sparsely populated areas. If animal wastes and discards are not properly treated, they can cause water, land, and air pollution, and diseases.'
 '### Commercial livestock-keeping  \nCommercial livestock-keeping involves rearing of animals for the purpose of selling their products such as meat, milk, wool and hides. Ranching, as part of commercial livestock-keeping, is mostly practised in more remote areas where land is extensive and population density is low. Extensive land provides sufficient grass to support a large number of animals. Commercial livestock-keeping is determined by factors such as capital, level of technology, market, availability of pasture and climatic conditions. In temperate regions, supplementary food such as hay and root crops are used to feed them during winter. Animals are kept for meat (beef cattle), for milk (dairy cattle and camel) and for wool (sheep).'
 '#### Advantages of commercial livestock-keeping:  \nCommercial livestock-keeping acts as a source of raw materials for industries such as food processing, shoe, and cloth making. It is one of the sectors which employs people and serves as a source of government revenue. Commercial livestock-keeping provides food products such as meat and milk consumed by households and industries. Moreover, it contributes to the production of goods such as shoes, bags, and animal foods. The benefits of commercial livestock-keeping include the ability to utilize breeds that can enhance reproductive performance. This practice also stimulates the development of transport and communication. Commercial livestock-keeping also facilitates the control of diseases and pests because it limits animal movement. It also uses high technology and scientific methods in management.'
 '#### Characteristics of commercial livestock-keeping  \nCommercial livestock-keeping takes place on a large area with low population density. More space is needed for the construction of ranches and growing grass for feeding livestock. Generally, commercial livestock-keeping is practiced in more remote areas where other forms of land use are limited. Usually, one type of animal is kept for quality control of products. In addition, commercial livestock-keeping is capital-intensive as it demands money for buying land, paying for labor, fencing, and buying machines and equipment. Furthermore, crossbreeding in commercial livestock-keeping is an important management practice.'
 '#### Challenges facing livestock-keeping:  \nLivestock-keeping faces a number of challenges. Climatic changes resulting in prolonged drought may lead to a shortage of water and pasture which may cause animal deaths. In tropical conditions, animals are infected by tsetse flies, causing nagana disease. There are also diseases such as East Coast Fever, Rift Valley Fever (RVF), Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD). Inadequate financial capital government for investing in commercial livestock farming is another challenge.'

Oil from the kernel is obtained by crushing the nuts in a grinder and compressing them. The extracted palm oil is packed in containers ready for domestic use and export.'
 '#### Conditions necessary for growing oil palm:  \nOil palm grows well in areas with high temperatures throughout the year with mean monthly temperature of over 21°C, heavy rainfall throughout the year (about 1,500 mm to 2,040 mm), and needs a well-drained soil to enable water to pass through.'
 '#### Farm preparation, planting and care of oil palm:  \nFarm preparation takes place before transplanting. Palm oil seeds are sown in nurseries which are later transplanted to a farm when they are 12-14 months old. Palm oil plants begin bearing fruits when they are five years old and reach maximum production after 8-10 years. After ten years, yields start to decline. Palm fruits usually grow in large bunches. Each oil palm plant has a capacity of bearing between two and ten bunches annually.

The government has been emphasising the use of revenue from natural gas to benefit the people in the areas producing the gas and the nation as a whole. The revenue from natural gas is used to improve social services in education and health. There have been various public programmes aimed to educate the public on natural gas benefits. The ministries responsible for energy and mineral resources in Tanzania conduct awareness creation programmes through various ways such as meetings and the media. The government also provides opportunities for training to Tanzanians in oil and natural gas. These training opportunities aim to build the country’s capacity for exploration, extraction, processing and supplying of natural gas.'
 '#### Challenges of natural gas production in Tanzania:  \nNatural gas production faces numerous challenges in different aspects. Natural gas is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, care has to be when extracting this resource. Natural gas production is new in Tanzania and, thus, it faces a shortage of skilled labour, especially in exploration and extraction activities. As a result, the government is often forced to employ foreign experts who are paid high salaries. Regarding the capacity to produce the natural gas, Tanzania has not been able to allocate enough funds for exploration, extraction, processing and distribution.'
 'Tanzania benefits a lot from its natural gas resources. The resources benefit the economy of the country but also improve the lives of its people. Natural gas has contributed to the improvement of infrastructure. Transport and communication systems to and from source of natural gas areas have been improved. For example, the discovery and extraction of gas in Mtwara Region has stimulated improvement of the airport and the harbour in the region. As a result, air transport to and from Mtwara Region has also improved. Natural gas has also created the demand for labour, goods and services. There has been an increase in the demand for both skilled and unskilled labour to work in the mines and carry out mining-related activities. Moreover, natural gas extraction has added a source of income for the people. Companies involved in natural gas extraction usually pay taxes and other dues to the government. People living nearby natural gas extraction fields also benefit by selling goods,'
 '### Addressing challenges to power and energy harnessing in Tanzania:  \nDespite the challenges to harnessing power and energy, the following are some of the solutions to the challenges facing power and energy harnessing in Tanzania.  \nAlternative sources of power: Alternative sources of power to support the existing sources should be explored to meet the increasing power demand in Tanzania. By 2013, the annual power demand increase was between 10 percent and 15 percent. The demand for power and energy is expected to increase because of the new industries that are to be constructed.  \nFunds allocation for exploration: The government is required to allocate adequate funds for exploring other sources of power. Tanzania is endowed with many power and energy sources, which have not been yet harnessed due to lack of capital.  \nTraining of skilled personnel: More young Tanzanians should be trained on HEP and biogas exploration and production.'

They are sold locally and exported to earn foreign income. Other industrial uses of water include cooling and washing.'
 '#### Crushing and grinding:  \nCrushing and grinding intend to reduce the size of ores to extract the valuable minerals from the rock. At the low level, the ore is crushed and dissolved in water but at the advanced level water and other chemicals are mixed together to obtain the minerals. For example, in gold processing, sodium cyanide is added to the solution. The chemical dissolves the gold particles, leaving behind stones and other mineral wastes. A sodium cyanide solution containing gold particles is drained off and mixed up with zinc dust, which makes gold particles to solidify. The particles are then melted and moulded into different shapes.'
 '### The concept of transport  \nTransport refers to the physical movement of people, goods and services from one place to another. It is an important link between different parts of the world. Transport is one of the key sectors that play a crucial role in efforts aimed to achieve sustainable economic growth. The transport system ensures a balanced distribution of goods and services in different parts of the world. Transport is an important sector that enhances the socio-economic development of the world. For the transport sector to play its important role, it has to be developed and co-ordinated with the ultimate aim of bringing about a reliable, efficient, safe and environmentally-sound system of moving passengers and goods.'

Such increased population demands more food, shelter, clothes and other services. The following section explains the importance of manufacturing industries in the world.'
 '### The importance of manufacturing industries:  \n- (a) Manufacturing industries are sources of employment for both skilled and unskilled labour. These employees can raise their standards of living and improve quality of life with the income they earn. The income they earn caters for basic needs such as food, shelter, clothes and education.\n- (b) Manufacturing industries also lead to the diversification of the country’s economy due to their potentials for promoting other sectors of the economy. This reduces over-dependence on one or two economic sectors, which can be affected by fluctuation of prices in the world market.\n- (c) Manufacturing industries enable countries to process locally produced raw materials before they are exported. This process helps to add value to the exports.'
 '### Types of manufacturing industries  \nManufacturing industries can be grouped into two main types, namely, processing and fabrication industries.'
 '- (d) Manufacturing industries stimulate the development of infrastructure such as railways and roads. These means of transport are useful in carrying raw materials to manufacturing centers and the finished or unfinished goods to the markets.\n- (e) Industries also help to create a large internal market as workers get wages and salaries from industries which enable them to buy goods and services. In fact, the more the workers, the larger the market for manufacturing industries.\n- (f) Manufacturing industries also lead to increased agricultural production. For example, the textile industry requires cotton as raw material. Thus, it can stimulate the expansion of cotton growing.\n- (g) Manufacturing industries are sources of foreign currency. The products manufactured in a country are exported to other countries for sale which, in turn, attract foreign currency.'
 '##### Market:  \nThe availability of a reliable market for the manufactured goods is one of the essential factors that account for the development of manufacturing industries. Availability of the markets can determine production efficiency. Industrial production depends on the demand for goods, which also determines the location of such industries.  \n###### Labour:  \nThe labour force required by an industry depends on the type of the manufacturing industry.

Some minerals have more demand than others due to their high value. Minerals are used in countries where they are produced and also they are exported to various countries to obtain foreign currency. The contribution of mining industries to the Tanzanian economy include the following:  \n- Government revenue: The mining industry contributes to government revenue in terms of taxes and royalties. This is crucial for financing developmental plans of the country.\n- Employment: The mining industry contributes direct and indirect employment opportunities within the country. Some people get employed directly in the industry while others provide services related to mining in mining centers.'
 '- National gross domestic product: The mining industry contributes to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). For example, mining and quarrying activities in Tanzania contributed about 4% to its GDP in 2015.\n- Raw materials: Minerals provide raw materials for various industries. For example, gypsum is used as a raw material in cement industries.\n- Social services: Mining stimulates the development of settlements. The establishment of settlements in or near mining centers forces the government to provide social services such as health, and education. In addition, the development of settlements around mining centers has contributed to the growth of some towns such as Mwadui, Kahama, Geita, and Mererani.\n- Infrastructure: Mining stimulates the construction of roads to and from mining centers.

It occupies parts of Iringa, Njombe, Mbeya, Ruvuma, Morogoro, Dodoma and Pwani Regions (Figure 3.8).The basin contains the Rufiji River which is the largest river in Tanzania. It originates from the south-western highlands. It has four main tributaries, namely, the Great Ruaha, Kilombero, Luwegu and the Rufiji lower section. These four tributaries join to form the Rufiji River.'
 'There are several socio-economic activities within the basin which benefit individuals and the nation. These include agriculture, tourism, hydropower generation,fisheries, mining and livestock keeping. Land in the Rufiji Basin is used mainly for agriculture, tourism, wildlife conservation, fisheries and mining. Agriculture is mainly practised in the Usangu Plain in Mbeya and Kilombero Basin in Morogoro.  \nApart from being rich in water resources and biodiversity, the basin is endowed with a good climate, fertile soil, minerals and human resources. It is known for its agricultural production and is often called the “bread basket” of Tanzania. Within the basin, there are important national parks (Kitulo, Ruaha, Mikumi, Udzungwa and Uluguru), large game reserves (the lower part of Selous, Rungwa, Usangu, Mpanga/ Kipengere, and Lunda), forest reserves, and pasture for livestock. Fishery is practised in the Kilombero, Great Ruaha and Rufiji rivers.'
 'Mining projects are developed in the Selous Basin at Namtumbo District where Uranium is developed and copper project in Iringa District at Nyang’oro Hills. Because of its large agricultural, hydroelectric and other potentials, the basin is the focus of the Government of Tanzania, donor and private development plans. It has also attracted large numbers of people migrating to the area seeking land for cropping and raising livestock. According to the national census of 2012, the districts within the basin had 9,032,089 people compared to 3,055,051 in 2002.

 'The countries that depend on floating logs in water as the main means of transport, face challenges to transport heavy logs. Timber transportation may also pose a challenge especially when forests are located in remote areas away from market centers. In fact, this situation increases the transportation cost for harvested forest resources. For example, in the equatorial rainforest, forests are dense and located in hardly accessible areas and, therefore, making it difficult to transport logs to the processing areas. Seasonal variation of water in rivers is also a challenge for timber transportation. Water in rivers fluctuate seasonally. During the dry season, the volume of water decreases whereas during the rainy season the volume increases. In this case, the reduction in the volume of water in the rivers hinders the transportation of logs to the processing industries.

42,Please can you create a true or false statement about the features of commercial livestock farming for my classwork task?,True or False: Commercial livestock-keeping takes place in areas with high population density.,"['### Commercial livestock-keeping  \nCommercial livestock-keeping involves rearing of animals for the purpose of selling their products such as meat, milk, wool and hides. Ranching, as part of commercial livestock-keeping, is mostly practised in more remote areas where land is extensive and population density is low. Extensive land provides sufficient grass to support a large number of animals. Commercial livestock-keeping is determined by factors such as capital, level of technology, market, availability of pasture and climatic conditions. In temperate regions, supplementary food such as hay and root crops are used to feed them during winter. Animals are kept for meat (beef cattle), for milk (dairy cattle and camel) and for wool (sheep).'
 '#### Characteristics of commercial livestock-keeping  \nCommercial livestock-keeping takes place on a large area with low population density. More space is needed for the construction of ranches and growing grass for feeding livestock. Generally, commercial livestock-keeping is practiced in more remote areas where other forms of land use are limited. Usually, one type of animal is kept for quality control of products. In addition, commercial livestock-keeping is capital-intensive as it demands money for buying land, paying for labor, fencing, and buying machines and equipment. Furthermore, crossbreeding in commercial livestock-keeping is an important management practice.'
 '#### Advantages of commercial livestock-keeping:  \nCommercial livestock-keeping acts as a source of raw materials for industries such as food processing, shoe, and cloth making. It is one of the sectors which employs people and serves as a source of government revenue. Commercial livestock-keeping provides food products such as meat and milk consumed by households and industries. Moreover, it contributes to the production of goods such as shoes, bags, and animal foods. The benefits of commercial livestock-keeping include the ability to utilize breeds that can enhance reproductive performance. This practice also stimulates the development of transport and communication. Commercial livestock-keeping also facilitates the control of diseases and pests because it limits animal movement. It also uses high technology and scientific methods in management.'
 ""### Livestock-keeping  \nLivestock-keeping is the rearing of animals and poultry for food and commercial purposes. The word 'livestock' applies primarily to cattle or dairy cows, goats, pigs, camels, horses, mules, poultry, and sheep. The word 'livestock' applies primarily to cattle or dairy cows, goats, pigs, camels, horses, mules, poultry and sheep. Poultry includes ducks, chicken, turkey, and geese. The population growth and ever increasing demand for food supply lead to the growth of livestock-keeping. Livestock-keeping contributes to the economic development of a country since it is a source of food as well as raw materials for industries. It is also a source of income as well as employment opportunities. Besides, it is a source of foreign currency.""
 '### Large-scale crop cultivation:  \nLarge-scale crop cultivation is a farming system that covers a large area of land to produce one type of crop for commercial purposes. This type of large-scale farming is also known as commercial agriculture.  \nIn large-scale crop cultivation, the type of farming practise is mostly monoculture, in which a single crop is produced in large quantities. In developing countries monoculture is associated with tropical and sub-tropical plantation which were established through European colonisation. After independence of individual countries, the plantations were owned by government and others were allocated to individuals as small holders and peasant farmers. These plantations also known as estates are large and found in sparsely populated areas.'

43,Need a describing question for form two about raising livestock in Tanzania,"How does livestock-keeping in Tanzania differ from livestock-keeping in Australia, particularly in terms of rearing systems and the level of industrial processing of animal products?","['Livestock-keeping in Tanzania, on the contrary, is mainly for meeting domestic demands with some few animals and animal products being exported, but on a lower scale than in Australia. In Tanzania, sheep and goats are kept for meat and skins. Moreover, the application of science and technology in livestock-keeping is much more advanced in Australia than it is in Tanzania. The main rearing system of livestock-keeping in Tanzania is pastoralism and zero-grazing, whereas in Australia it is primarily the ranching system. In addition, Australia has many industries for processing animal products, whereas in Tanzania efforts are underway to establish such industries on a commercial scale.'
 'In both countries, dairy farming is practised where there is adequate water supply and plenty of pasture. Overall, the development of the livestock-keeping sector is important in both countries. Moreover, the two countries practise livestock at both the subsistence and commercial levels. The animals and their products can be used to meet family needs and sometimes be sold to raise revenue. In Tanzania, sedentary livestock-keeping is practised in densely populated areas and, hence, with a shortage of land such as the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro and the Southern Highlands whereas in Australia it is practised specifically in the South East of the country.'
 '### Focal studies  \n#### Livestock-keeping in Tanzania  \nLivestock production is one of the major agricultural activities in Tanzania. It contributes to the availability of food and raw materials. The sector also contributes to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The National Ranching Company (NARCO) is responsible for managing all public ranches in the country. Most of the livestock products are for the domestic market. This sub-sector needs to be developed particularly in dairy farming and its products and meat processing to meet the domestic demands and for export. Overall, livestock-keeping helps to reduce household poverty and ensure food security.'
 '##### Ways of solving challenges facing livestock-keeping in Tanzania:  \nChallenges to livestock-keeping canbereducedthroughencouraging and supporting individual livestock keepers and their groups to buy modern accessories such as modern cattle sheds, cattle mats and cool roofs that would improve their livestock-keeping. In this regard, they would need support with training in modern livestock-keeping coupled with easily accessible extension services. For commercial livestock-keeping, there is a need to attract foreign investment in the sector but such investment should also be geared towards benefiting local people. Availability of domestic and international markets will promote livestock-keeping significantly.'
 'In Tanzania and Australia livestock-keeping is important because it stimulates other sectors of the economy, for example, the development of transport and communication networks and processing industries such as leather and milk. Moreover, livestock-keeping promotes trade through selling animals and animal products within and outside these two countries. It also promotes employment to different people who work in processing industries. Livestock-keeping provides skins, hides, cheese, butter, milk, and meat. These products are sold and enable individual households and the nation to earn money. Furthermore, the sector generates revenue to these countries through tax collection from the industries operating in this livestock sector. It also encourages the use of marginal lands. Livestock-keeping, especially ranching and pastoralism, which need large open areas, make use of land which is otherwise not suitable for other uses. Farmers also apply cattle manure to add nutrients to the soil'

 '#### Differences between livestock-keeping in Tanzania and Australia:  \nLivestock-keeping in the two countries has the following differences: The majority of livestock in Australia is kept for commercial purposes. Australian sheep, particularly the Merino, are mainly kept for wool production. More than 60 percent of livestock products from Australia are exported to Europe and other continents.'
 '#### Similarities between livestock -keeping in Tanzania and Australia:  \nLivestock- keeping in Tanzania and Australia has the following similarities:\nBoth countries keep similar types of livestock, for example, cattle and poultry. Also, both countries have set aside areas for ranching. In Australia, ranching is found at Victoria River, Alexandria Station and Anna Creek. These places are found in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and theNorthernTerritory. Examples of ranches in Tanzania are Kongwa, Ruvu, Kagera, Arusha, Morogoro, Kitulo and Lushoto.'

 '#### Challenges facing livestock-keeping in Tanzania  \nPrevalence of pests and diseases affects animals’ health and, eventually, causes low or poor production. Also, over-grazing causes shortage of water, pasture and soil erosion. There is also a problem of poor transportation of livestock and livestock products from one place to another. In addition, low level of technology to improve the animal breeds as well as preserve animal products has been another limitation in the development of livestock-keeping in the country. These challenges lead to low quality and productivity. The low livestock production in turn, lowers the quality of life of livestock-keepers and affects development generally. Lack of reliable markets is a serious threat to the sustainability of the livestock-keeping sector.'

45,please i need a define question for value of forest resources for form 2,"Define forestry and explain its significance in sustainable development, according to the context provided.","['Human beings obtain various products and services from forests. Forest products can be timber and non-timber products that help to sustain human life. Non-timber forest products include fruits, honey, leaves, roots and barks. The process of managing forest resources for human use is known as forestry. Foresters engage in lumbering, which is an activity that involves cutting, transporting, processing and selling timber. The terms ‘timber’ and ‘log’ are used interchangeably to mean branches or pieces of the trunk of a tree, but with the bark attached. Harvesting of forest resources is generally sustainable when there is no or little damage to the general environment. A forest can be natural or planted. Animals, birds and insects use forests to support their lives. Forests provide aesthetic value and services to human beings.'
 '#### Importance of forest resources  \nForests have significant contribution to social, economic and ecological development. They provide various products for human use such as timber, poles, wood, logs, leaves, roots and honey.  \nSource of income: Forest products are sold in the country or exported to earn income. It is common for products such as timber, rubber, wood and poles to be exported to earn foreign currency. Likewise, forests make up 22.2% of household incomes in developing countries. The main forest products that contribute to incomes are fuel wood, building poles, timber and building materials.  \nPaper-based materials: Logs are processed to make different types of paper. Also some trees have tissues which are processed to make glue commonly known as wood-glue.'
 'Although forest resources contribute to the welfare of people, the forestry industry faces numerous challenges. Over-exploitation of forest resources is one of the challenges. Forest resources are harvested to the point of reducing their ability to regenerate. For example, some forest tree species, especially natural trees, are usually in high demand. The demand compels over-harvesting of such forest resources so much so that they face extinction. In some cases, forests are harvested without following governing procedures and, consequently, some tree species may disappear. Experience indicates that ungoverned exploitation is usually serious in public-owned natural forests than in private planted forests. Forests also face the problem of fire outbreaks with some fires occurring naturally while others are set by people. The fire, particularly during late burning, destroys trees and the undergrowth, which are the main constituents of forests. Estimates indicate that each year fires burn'
 'Medicinal value: Some forest trees have medicinal value. They have roots, leaves, and bark which are used as medicine or processed to make medicine for human beings and animals. For example, the bark of the cinchona tree is used in manufacturing quinine which is useful for treatment of malaria. Also, some trees are used in making herbicides for use in agriculture.  \nTourist attraction: Some forests have rare and unique species of animals and plants which attract people to observe. For example, Gombe Forests in Kigoma have chimpanzees, which are a great attraction for both local and foreign tourists. Many of the natural parks have forests that serve as habitats for attracting animals and plants.  \nRainfall formation: Areas with heavy forests are characterised by frequent rainfall. For example, in the Amazon forests, 30 percent of rainfall is said to be influenced by moist air from trees.'
 '## Chapter Four (Sustainable use of forest resources)  \n### Introduction  \nIn this chapter, you will learn about types of forests, distribution of forests by type, factors for their distribution, and the importance of forests in social and economic life.

Solar and wind energy in USA is important in so many ways.  \nEnvironmentally-friendly: The production of solar and wind energy involves activities which produce less waste in the environment compared to other sources of energy. These energies, therefore, are considered to be environmentally-friendly. For example, their production reduces the emission of carbon-dioxide and other pollutants.  \nCreation of employment opportunities: Installation and management of solar panels and wind mills require many employees. This industry generates jobs for thousands of people.'
 'Renewable and non-renewable energy: Renewable energy is energy generated from sources that are essentially inexhaustible. Examples of renewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, geothermal energy, tidal power, and hydroelectric power. Non-renewable energy includes conventional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which are likely to get depleted with use.  \nConventional and non-conventional energy: Conventional energy is an energy source which is fixed in nature like oil, gas, coal, and hydropower generation. It is also termed as non-renewable energy or thermal energy. The conventional energy resources are being used extensively; as a result, their known reserves have been depleted to a great extent. The use of conventional energy has emerging effects on the environment. The non-conventional energy involves energy generated by wind, tides, solar and biomass. These are renewable sources of energy and not exhaustible.'
 'Renewable energy sources: Renewable energy is any energy source that is naturally replaced. The energy can be derived from sunlight, tides, wind, water, geothermal, or hydroelectric action. Likewise, energy produced from the refining of various forms of biomass is often classified as renewable. The renewable energy sources are usually regarded as environmentally friendly because they release few chemicals that can harm the environment. These are energy resources that are naturally reused. Renewable sources are sustainable if they are carefully managed and maintained. They have minimal negative effects on the environment. Renewable energy sources include sunlight, geothermal heat, wind, tides, water, and various forms of biomass. Some of these energy sources are described in the following sub-sections.'
 '### Solar and wind energy harnessing in USA  \nUSA is one of the leading countries in the world harnessing energy from the Sun. Before 2008, much of the electricity was generated from other sources such as fossil fuel and HEP. By 2018, solar power accounted for 1.44 percent of the total USA electricity, generating about 58.9 terawatt-hours (TWH).  \nUSA needs energy that is secure, reliable, protective of the environment, and able to address climate change, create jobs and improve public health. USA reduced the use of fossil fuel as a source of energy because it is expensive and not renewable. The American Government reduces the cost of solar power and increases the cost of fossil fuel to encourage use of the former. USA, as a highly developed country in terms of technology and economy, has a very high demand for power and energy for industrial and domestic use.'
 'Industrial development: In USA, solar and wind energy have been found to be feasible sources of alternative energy for industrial development. The energy generated is considered cheaper than other available sources of energy such as fossil energy, HEP, natural gas, and nuclear energy.  \nExpansion of agriculture: Large-scale agriculture has been made possible by the availability of electricity from this source. The power is used in irrigation and processing of agricultural products.  \nAffordability: Solar and wind energy are relatively cheaper for many people in USA especially those who are unable to use other sources of electricity because it is subsidized by the government. This has improved their living standards.'

47,"Hi, could you create a short-answer question related to the impact of population dynamics on small-scale farming for my classwork?",How can the government and other organizations help improve small-scale crop cultivation in areas affected by rapid population growth according to the textbook information provided?,"['#### Relationship between population growth and small-scale crop production:  \nPopulation growth is an increase in the number of people in a particular area. Rapid population growth could be due to natural increase or in-migration. The rapid population growth puts more pressure on small-scale farmers. Yet, subsistence farmers are not likely to raise their output to feed the growing numbers because of lack of capital. Subsequently, land becomes overpopulated and resources overused. Also high population growth is associated with smaller farms and lower farm wages. As a result households in densely populated areas increasingly rely on off-farm income.'
 '#### Effects of rapid population growth on small-scale crop cultivation:  \nOverpopulation does not depend merely on the total number of people living in an area, or on the population density. It depends much on the available resources in a given area. When an area has more people than it can support to give them a reasonable standard of living, the area will suffer from overpopulation or population pressure. If the area has inhabitants who are too few to develop the resources available to improve living conditions, then the area suffers from under-population.'
 '## Chapter Two (Agriculture)  \n### Introduction  \nIn this chapter, you will learn about the meaning and types of agriculture, the effects of rapid population growth on small-scale agriculture, characteristics of small-scale agriculture, advantages and disadvantages of small-scale agriculture, and ways of improving small-scale agriculture. You will also learn about types of large-scale agriculture in the world, major crops grown in each type of large-scale agriculture, characteristics of large-scale agriculture and problems facing large-scale agriculture in Tanzania and the USA. Finally, you will learn about the various types of livestock keeping practices as well as their benefits and constraints by focusing on Tanzania and Australia.'
 'The resulting population growth affects land use patterns. This may cause shortage of food and poor living standards. The solution to this problem is to improve small-scale crop cultivation. The government and other organisations should help farmers by providing them with education and capital to make subsistence agriculture more intensive and more productive. Moreover, the government, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and co-operative societies should help the farmers to select better seeds, use proper insecticides, pesticides, and apply fertilisers properly. In addition, they should help in providing transport to make sure the products reach proper storage places and markets. Furthermore, the government should emphasise and support the opening of joint agriculture ventures, finding of markets for surplus products and establishing good storage facilities. Additionally, deliberate efforts should be made to provide education on good farming practises, for example, the use of simple'
 '#### Advantages of small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop production is cheap to operate since it involves the use of simple farming tools such as hand hoes and machetes. It is also cheap because the sources of labour are family members and, hence, easy to manage. In addition, small-scale agriculture needs small capital since it operates on small pieces of land. This type of agriculture when integrated with livestock-keeping provides biomass which is useful in the production of biogas energy. This energy is commonly used for cooking. Another advantage of small-scale crop cultivation is that farmers get fresh food such as vegetables and fruits. Therefore, small-scale agriculture contributes to the development of local communities.'

48,send me a define question for my students about Post-harvest processing and transport of cloves.,"In what season does the harvesting of cloves typically occur in Zanzibar, according to the information provided in the textbook?","['#### Harvesting, processing and transportation of cloves:  \nClove trees can grow up to 15 meters high. Therefore, harvesting involves picking of flower buds which is done by climbing or scaling.\nHarvesting is done by hand by skilled climbers. In Zanzibar, the harvesting occurs from September to November.\nSorting is necessary to separate leaves from the buds. The buds and flowers are left to dry in the sun for 3 - 7 days.\nTo ensure quality, the dirty and unwanted particles are removed from the dried cloves. The Zanzibar State Trading Corporation (ZSTC) is an organ responsible for buying and exporting cloves from the Isles in Tanzania to major importers such as Taiwan, India, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.'
 '#### Harvesting, processing and transportation of sisal:  \nHarvesting of sisal begins when the colour of thorns at the tips changes from dark brown to light-brown. The processing of leaves should take place 48 hours after being harvested. Through processing, sisal fibres are obtained whereby the leaves are crushed between rollers and then mechanically scraped. Then the fibres are washed and dried. Drying of fibres is done in the sun or by using drying machines. This is followed by brushing of the dried fibres for straightening as well as polishing. Thereafter, the fibres are graded depending on their length and colour. It is important to ensure cleanliness of the bale. Graded fibres are then packed into bales either manually or by using machines.'
 '#### Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation:  \nHarvesting of coffee berries is done by hand. Only the red ripe berries are picked. Berries are dried in the sun and then are sorted, weighed and transported to the processing mills. Since coffee can easily absorb external odours which can affect its quality, it must be stored in cool, dark, and dry places to ensure freshness.'
 '##### Harvesting, processing, and transportation of wheat:  \nIn the process of harvesting, there is a need to test the crop. In this regard, fingers are used to rub the wheat head and pieces of grain are chewed. If the grains crack in the mouth and become soft as they are chewed, then they are ready for harvesting. Clean places are prepared for keeping the harvested wheat. When using a sickle for harvesting, it should be checked to make sure it is sharp enough for making clean cuts. In commercial farming, Rice the combine harvester is adjusted to harvest the wheat. Harvesting is done when the crop reaches maturity (at least 100 days). The part that is harvested is called kernels. Freshly harvested wheat is taken to a local grain elevator as soon as possible after harvest.'
 '#### Uses of cloves:  \nCloves can be used in the production of oil which is used in dentistry, sanitary applications and as medicine. They also serve as a spice in food. Moreover, cloves add flavor in tea and cigarettes.

Some of them are high cost of production as agriculture in the USA is highly mechanised. Automatic irrigation and agricultural machinery require fossil fuels and other sources of energy to run them. The increase in the price of fossil fuel, therefore, increases the cost of production. At times, there is a shortage of water as irrigation requires a lot of water. The amount of underground water drawn for irrigation is increasing whereas the amount of water to refill is decreasing; which results in shortage of water for agricultural use. Another problem has to do with loss of soil fertility as the soil is eroded faster than it can be replenished due to over- cultivation. Also, over-irrigation causes leaching of soil nutrients.'
 'Other challenges include the high cost of land management in large-scale agriculture where monoculture is a common practise. Monoculture exhausts nutrients from the soil that requires constant application of fertilisers. Natural disasters such as drought, hurricanes, floods and tornadoes also pose severe challenges to agricultural production. Crops are damaged by periodic drought, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes. This damage leads to low production which, ultimately, affects the economy. The natural disasters also affect transportation network which finally hinders the movement of agricultural products from the field to storage and market centers.'
 'The resulting population growth affects land use patterns. This may cause shortage of food and poor living standards. The solution to this problem is to improve small-scale crop cultivation.

 '#### Characteristics of large-scale crop cultivation:  \nLarge-scale crop cultivation is characterized by cultivation of a large area with the application of high level of technology. The technology involves the use of tractors, combine harvesters, and processing machines. As large-scale farming is highly mechanized, it employs few skilled people because machines carry out agricultural activities that otherwise could have been done manually by humans.  \nIn addition, such commercial farming is capital-intensive to support the production. Also, it is often based on a single crop, a practise known as monoculture. Chemical fertilisers are highly used to maximise yields. Large-scale agriculture is basically a source of raw materials for different manufacturing industries.  \nFigure 2.1 Coffee plant berries  \nsource:https/www.gettyimages.com/photo/coffee-plant'

 '### Methods of mineral processing  \nMineral processing involves separating valuable minerals from other materials. There are different methods through which minerals can be processed as described below.'
 '#### Mining  \nMining is a process of extracting valuable geological substances from the crust of the earth. The extracted materials may be minerals, fossil fuels, and other geological materials. However, not all geological substances are categorized as minerals. In science, a mineral has specific characteristics such as being solid, inorganic, naturally occurring, has definite chemical composition and ordered internal structure. Although oil, coal and natural gas do not possess most of these characteristics, they may be categorized as minerals. From a non-scientific view, a mineral refers to a non-living naturally occurring resource from the earth. As such, oil, coal, and natural gas also qualify to be called mineral resources. Thus, petroleum and natural gas which are discussed as case studies in this chapter are treated as minerals. Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water.'
 '#### In-situ mining:  \nIn-situ mining is a mining process used to recover minerals such as copper and uranium through boreholes drilled into a deposit, in-situ. It involves dissolving the existing mineral resource and then processing it on the surface without moving rock from the ground.'
 'There are two main types of mining, namely, surface and underground mining. Minerals such as salts are found close to the earth surface; as such, open cast method of mining is used to exploit them. Other minerals like gold and diamond are found deep in the ground, hence undergound mining methods are used to obtain them.  \nThe world is full of different types of minerals. Minerals can be classified into five main groups, that is, rocks used as building stones, and for brick making; non-metallic minerals such as salt, sulphur, nitrates, and asbestos; metals like gold, iron, and silver; mineral fuels including coal, petroleum and gas; and water.

2,I need a short-answer question explaining the importance of hydroelectric power and biogas in Tanzania.,Explain two ways in which hydroelectric power and biogas contribute to the economy and local communities in Tanzania.,"['### Importance of HEP and biogas energy resources in Tanzania  \nTanzania’s major electrical energy is obtained primarily from HEP followed by natural gas. These energy sources are important to the economy of the country. HEP and biogas energy are important in many ways.  \nUse at the local level: Production of biogas requires simple technology, which can be handled by any interested person. Based on technological simplicity, biogas is prominent at local levels in Tanzania.  \nWaste management: Use of biogas enhances management of wastes mainly animal dung. All animal dung around people’s homes is collected and ferried to the processing area to produce power. People with many livestock find biogas production as an effective way of keeping their areas clean.'
 '### Hydro-electric power and biogas in Tanzania:  \nHydro-electric power, as discussed earlier, is produced by utilizing the power of fast-moving water such as a waterfall. HEP is one of the main sources of power in Tanzania. In Tanzania, electricity generation depends heavily on HEP. However, this type of energy cannot be relied upon in times of drought. The government through the Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO), a parastatal organization, manages the HEP across the country. The company produces hydro-electricity from natural waterfalls or man-made dams and supplies it to the users in the country.'
 '## Chapter Eight (Sustainable use of power and energy resources)  \n### Introduction  \nPower and energy are important for every aspect of human life. They may be generated from waves, winds, waterfalls, solar, natural gases, geothermo, oil and coal. In this chapter, you will learn about the major sources of power, the methods of acquiring and extracting power and energy, and the uses of power and energy resources. You will also learn about the problems facing power and energy production, specifically solar and wind power production in the USA, hydroelectric and biogas production in Tanzania. Finally, you will learn about problems related to power and energy extraction in the USA and Tanzania.'
 'Reduced over-dependence on fuelwood: The use of biogas reduces over-dependence on fuelwood as a source of energy. In areas where biogas is used, people have reduced the use of fuelwood for heating and cooking. This may in turn reduce deforestation and emission of greenhouse gases.  \nMajor source of electricity: HEP is a major source of electricity, which is widely used in Tanzania. As the government centrally manages HEP by 98 percent, all the regions access it through TANESCO, a public utility company, and puts it into various uses, lighting being the main use.  \nImprovement of standards of living: The availability of biogas and hydro-electric power in rural areas has improved people’s standards of living. With power, people have managed to start small projects such as welding, carpentry, and milling. Such projects have become sources of income for the people and have improved their standards of living.'
 '### Challenges to harnessing power and energy in Tanzania:  \nPower and energy harnessing in Tanzania faces various challenges ranging from naturally occurring to human-made ones. The following are some of the challenges facing power and energy harnessing in Tanzania.  \nFluctuation of river volume: In the dry season, rain may be scarce or completely absent which reduces water in dams and, consequently, lowers the generation of HEP. Tanzania has been experiencing periods of power-cut particularly during the dry season because of over-dependence on HEP.'

4,I need a quick short-answer question about the benefits from water resources for my form 2 students.,How does water as a means of transport contribute to economic growth according to the context information provided?,"['Water resource management refers to the process of planning, developing, distributing and managing the effective use of water resources. In today’s interconnected world, there is no doubt about the value of integrated planning for sustainable development. There is a need to have an integrated water resources management that supports the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. Integrated Water Resources Management is one of the initiatives for sustainable use of water resources, and it refers to a process of promoting the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources, in order to maximise the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems. The management helps to protect the environment, foster economic growth and sustainable agricultural development, promote democratic participation in governance, and improve human health.'
 '#### Resources obtained from water  \nA resource is anything useful that can be utilised if necessary. It is a stock consisting of substances such as water, minerals, air, forestry resources or land. Water resources are essential and important assets for human beings. There are different types of water resources. These include fish, plantations, oil, natural gas, decoration materials, salt and some building materials. The seas and oceans possess mineral riches whose exploitation could be of great use to people. Exploitation of oil in Nigeria has made the country one of the stable countries in Africa in terms of economic development. The seas and oceans possess a wealth of minerals such as copper, manganese, nickel, cobalt and salt. Apart from vast oilfields, the continental shelves are rich in gas fields. All these water resources are of great use for the wellbeing of people in Africa.'
 'Access to water is fundamental to economic and social development. However, population growth, rapid urbanisation and industrialisation, the expansion of agriculture and tourism, and climate change all put water under increasing stress. This situation has impacted negatively the socio-economic development of most developing countries. As a result, at the global level, there is a major concern regarding the management of water resources. Water resources management emerged as a response to real and foreseen water crises and increasingly unsustainable pressure on the freshwater resources, which emanate from rising populations, growing demands for water due to competing water uses, and increasing pollution.'
 'on lakes and oceans facilitates the importation and exportation of various goods such as machines and vehicles. In fact, water as a means of transport is likely to reduce the transport cost compared to other means of transport and, hence, contribute meaningfully to economic growth. Water is the habitat for aquatic organisms such as fish which are useful to human beings. Usually, water bodies such as oceans, sea, lakes, rivers, dams and ponds attract fishing and, hence, fishing related activities. Fishing provides human beings with food and income through local selling and exportation of fishing products.

5,I require detailed explanation question for students to understand deep the economic impact of petroleum in Middle Eastern countries,Explain in detail the economic impacts of petroleum production on Middle Eastern countries based on the provided context.,"['#### Importance of oil production to Middle East countries:  \nThe Middle East is located in an arid region. Oil production has contributed to economic and social development of the Middle East countries. The countries depend greatly on the exportation of petroleum and petroleum products to earn foreign currency. Companies involved in oil production in most of the Middle East countries are mostly state-owned. However, there are also some oil fields run by private companies. These companies pay taxes to the government. The revenue from oil refining and support industries is used to provide social services such as education and health. The revenue is also used in the construction and improvement of infrastructure such as roads, railways, and airports. Jobs are also created in areas that produce oil as many people in the Middle East work in the petroleum refineries and petrochemical industries.'
 'Oil production in the Middle East has stimulated the improvement of the transport sector. The export of petroleum and petroleum products has enabled Middle East countries to develop good transport networks. In addition, petroleum is a resource which provides energy and power for domestic and industrial purposes.'
 'Oil production in the Middle East faces many challenges. With rising global demand, highly volatile prices are increasingly becoming stringent. The oil and gas industry faces three major challenges involving how to reduce costs, optimize the performance of its industrial base assets, and address its environmental footprint. Environmental pollution is one of these challenges. Oil refinery and production of petroleum products produce carbon dioxide and other gases such as methane which are harmful. As countries in the Middle East have large oil production industries, the emission of harmful gases is also high. These gases contribute to the pollution of water, air, and land. Burning fossil fuels produces sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. When they move into the atmosphere they produce acid rain, which damages buildings and vegetation in addition to affecting fish and other organisms that live in water. Another challenge facing oil production in the Middle East has to do with civil wars'
 '### Focal studies  \n#### Oil production in the Middle East  \nThe Middle East is one of the leading oil-producing areas in the world.

6,"hello, I need to give my students a deep explanation question on cultivation techniques for sisal",Explain the process of harvesting and processing sisal according to the information provided in the textbook.,"['### Sisal  \nSisal is a tropical plant whose leaves produce strong threads (fibres) which are used for various purposes such as rope and carpet making. Sisal was originally grown in southern Mexico. Subsequently, it has been widely cultivated in many other countries. In fact, it has widely been introduced in the tropics and subtropics. In Tanzania, sisal was introduced in 1893 by Dr Richard Hindorf and the first 62 sisal plants were planted near Pangani in Tanga Region. Until the 1960s, Tanzania was the leading producer of sisal, but since then Brazil has become the major world producer of sisal, followed by Tanzania, Kenya, Madagascar and China. In Tanzania, sisal is grown in Tanga, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Morogoro, Lindi and Mtwara regions.  \nFigure 2.7 Sisal farm in Tanga  \nSource: https://www.ippmedia.com/en/news/strategising-restore-sisal-cash-crop-day'
 '#### Harvesting, processing and transportation of sisal:  \nHarvesting of sisal begins when the colour of thorns at the tips changes from dark brown to light-brown. The processing of leaves should take place 48 hours after being harvested. Through processing, sisal fibres are obtained whereby the leaves are crushed between rollers and then mechanically scraped. Then the fibres are washed and dried. Drying of fibres is done in the sun or by using drying machines. This is followed by brushing of the dried fibres for straightening as well as polishing. Thereafter, the fibres are graded depending on their length and colour. It is important to ensure cleanliness of the bale. Graded fibres are then packed into bales either manually or by using machines.'
 'Bulbils are initially grown in nurseries before being transplanted in double rows after a year. In the nursery, the bulbils should be planted in beds at 10 cm x 10 cm apart. It is recommended to use sisal waste for their growth. Thereafter, they are shifted to a second bed where they are planted at 30 cm x 30 cm apart. After 12 to 18 months, the young sisal plants are ready to be planted in the field. Unlike many other crops, sisal does not need much care. However, when it is planted on a previously used old land, it is important to use fertiliser. During the first two years it is important to control weeds by hand, machines or chemicals. Although the sisal plant is resistant to pests and diseases, it is important to control pests and diseases such as sisal weevil and bole rot. Growing sisal does not require irrigation as the sisal plant is drought-resistant and cultivated as a rain-fed crop.'
 '#### Uses of sisal:  \nSisal is used to make ropes, buffing cloth, mattresses, carpets, handicraft mats, and baskets. Sisal is commonly used in the shipping industry for mooring small craft, lashing, and handling cargo. It is also used in the automobile industry with fiber glass in composite materials. Other products developed from sisal fibre include lumbar support belts, rugs, slippers, clothes and disc buffers. Farmers also use sisal fibre for tomato plant support and ropes for reinforcement of ceiling corners. Waste from sisal extraction can be used for making biogas, pharmaceutical ingredients and building materials. Fibres can also be used as fertiliser or animal feed.'
 '#### Conditions for growing sisal:  \nSisal growing needs high temperatures ranging between 25°C and 30°C. It also needs slight rainfall ranging from 650 mm to 1,500 mm. It is grown in well-drained loamy soil. This type of soil contains a lot of decayed vegetable matter with little amounts of sand and clay. Rainfall plays an important role as far as fibre production is concerned. On the whole, sisal does not need too much rainfall and cannot tolerate frosty conditions.'

7,"Good morning, may I get a true/false statement about traits of deciduous forests for our class discussion?",True or False: Deciduous forests contain trees with needle-like leaves and cone-shaped fruits.,"['#### Characteristics of a deciduous forest  \nDeciduous forests have characteristics that distinguish them from other types of forests. They contain trees with broad leaves. Trees in these forests usually shed their leaves in autumn and they remain leafless throughout the cold winters to minimize loss of water by transpiration. Deciduous forests are composed of a mixture of various tree species. Deciduous forest trees include oak, elm, chestnut, maple, willow, ash, and beech.'
 '#### Deciduous forests:  \nDeciduous forests are composed mainly of broad-leaved trees that shed all their leaves during the dry season. Figure 4.5 shows a part of a deciduous forest. These forests are located between 300 and 500 North and South of the Equator. They are found in the eastern side of North America, Western Europe, Northern Coast of China, Japan, Southern and Western Australia.'
 'Rainfall: The distribution of forests is also influenced by rainfall. Forests thrive well in areas with plenty of rainfall of over 1200 mm throughout the year. The dense equatorial forests have thrived well because of the presence of heavy rainfall that is well distributed throughout the year. In deciduous forest regions, trees that can survive the dry season exist. These trees shed their leaves during the dry season to reduce water loss through transpiration as their means of survival. Relief is another factor that influences the distribution of forests. It determines soil, temperature and vegetation distribution across gradient. Tree distribution varies with altitude. For example, on Mount Kilimanjaro at 1800-3000 m above sea level, forests consist of diverse tree species. At higher altitude (3000 m), alpine heath dominate. Thus, differences in relief are associated with variations in the type of forests.'
 '#### Natural forests:  \nA natural forest refers to a collection of trees that have grown naturally. The types of natural forests include equatorial rainforest, tropical monsoon, deciduous, coniferous and mangrove. The natural forests are found in many countries. Figure 4.1 shows the distribution of various world natural forests.'
 '#### Coniferous forests  \nConiferous forests have needle-like leaves and cone-shaped fruits. They are found in areas with long winters and moderate to high annual precipitation. Coniferous forests are located between 500 and 700 North of the Equator. They cover an extensive area of North America and Asia. They are also found on highlands and in mountainous areas. In Tanzania, coniferous forests are found in Mufindi in Iringa and Njombe. The climatic condition in these areas is mostly cold, which supports the growth of coniferous trees.  \n| Figure 4.5                                            | Deciduous forest |\n| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |\n| Source: https://pediaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08 |                  |  \n| Figure 4.6 | Coniferous forest                                |\n| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n|            | Source: https://sites.google.com/site/teambarb28 |'

If desilting is ignored, the decreased depth of dams may affect the production of HEP since the storage capacity of the dam is severely reduced.\n- Alternative energy sources: Alternative sources of energy such as solar energy should be used to reduce the effect of pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels and fuelwood.\n- Environmental conservation projects: The establishment of power and energy production projects should go hand in hand with environmental conservation projects such as afforestation, reforestation, and proper waste management.'
 '## Chapter Eight (Sustainable use of power and energy resources)  \n### Introduction  \nPower and energy are important for every aspect of human life. They may be generated from waves, winds, waterfalls, solar, natural gases, geothermo, oil and coal. In this chapter, you will learn about the major sources of power, the methods of acquiring and extracting power and energy, and the uses of power and energy resources. You will also learn about the problems facing power and energy production, specifically solar and wind power production in the USA, hydroelectric and biogas production in Tanzania. Finally, you will learn about problems related to power and energy extraction in the USA and Tanzania.'
 '- Community awareness creation: Environmental conservation education should be provided to the people. Such education will encourage community members to report and take permanent or temporary measures in the utilization of power and energy to avoid endangering the environment.\n- Research on power and energy: There is a need for governments to invest comprehensively in research on power and energy resources to identify different sources of power and efficient use of the existing energy resources.\n- Technology: Environmentally friendly technologies for power and energy production should be developed.'
 '#### Addressing challenges facing solar and wind energy in USA:  \nThe challenges facing solar and wind energy production may hinder the expected harnessing of this potential energy if deliberate efforts are not made to address them.  \nInstallation of wind turbines and solar panels: Solar and wind energy depends very much on the number and quality of wind turbines and solar panels. The higher the quality of gadgets available, the more the amount of energy produced. It is, therefore, advisable to install enough wind turbines and solar panels over a wide area to increase the amount of energy harnessed.  \nResearch: Research on solar and wind energy is likely to find some solutions to many challenges facing the production of energy from wind and the sun. Research may involve studying the behaviour of wind and new technologies for tapping solar energy day and night.'

16,I need a question that requires the students to explain the obstacles faced in river basin projects,What are some of the obstacles faced in river basin projects according to the textbook?,"['#### Requirements for establishing a river basin project  \nAs river basin projects serve social and economic purposes, they need to be carefully designed by observing a number of issues. The following are some of the requirements which should be observed when establishing a river basin project:  \n- Construction of dams for retaining water.\n- Removal of silt or mud from the river or dam (dredging).\n- For transport purposes, the river channels should be straightened and widened so that they can accommodate more water.\n- Trees should be planted on marginal land, hill slopes, and riverbanks. This will help to control soil erosion and check the movement of surface run-off, to reduce or prevent silting and flooding.  \nIf such requirements are observed, river basin projects will achieve the expected benefits.'
 '#### Challenges facing river basin projects  \nRiver basin projects face numerous challenges. Many of these challenges are caused by natural events and human activitiesthattakeplaceinthebasins. These are described below.  \n##### Siltation  \nSiltation is one of the challenges facing river basin projects. The water in dams depends on the supply of water from highland areas through streams and rivers. Usually streams flowing into dams carry some sediments which ultimately accumulate in the dams. This accumulation of sediments leads to a decrease in the volume of water which may have numerous impacts. These impacts may include lowering the ability of dams to produce enough water necessary for electricity generation, in addition to affecting transport and destroying marine organisms.  \n##### Water pollution'
 'A good river basin requires a constant volume of water. This increases the possibility of carrying out various development projects. Projects which take place in river basins should not have negative impacts on the people or the environment. The impacts may include disturbing the habitat of various species such as fish. Other impacts are water pollution, disease outbreak, and resettlement of villages.  \nIn Tanzania, environmental impacts are controlled by carrying out Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). The EIA aims to establish potential environmental impacts that may be caused by a given project that is planned to be conducted. It is usually done by a registered expert through the National Environment Management Council (NEMC).'
 'River basin development also attracts irrigation. Due to the availability of water in a basin, commercial agriculture is established through irrigation schemes. Sometimes, individual peasants use a well-managed river basin for watering their small farms using traditional mechanisms such as buckets. In addition, river basin development projects involve planting of trees and construction of dams. They also involve strict measures for prohibiting deforestation and poor cultivation practises. All these measures aim to foster appropriate use of the land to keep it productive. These measures also enable the preservation of the ecosystem. By doing so, these projects contribute to preventing the land from being eroded by environmental problems such as soil erosion, floods and loss of soil fertility.'
 '### River basin development  \nA river basin is an area of land drained by a river and its tributaries. It has features such as tributaries, watershed and convergence.

The lower section of rivers is usually exposed to excessive rainwater, causing floods. To prevent floods, basin management establishes dams which serve as collection areas of excessive water. River basins in their natural state may hardly be safe for human settlement. In fact, the establishment of basin development projects increases the value of the basins and makes them more conducive for human settlement. This compels governments to extend social services such as infrastructure, health, and education.'

Construction of different infrastructure for social and economic support is a challenge to the forestry industry. Different construction activities lead to the devastation of forests. For example, the construction of dams, roads and railway lines forces the clearing of some forest hectares. In addition, population increase presents another challenge to the forestry industry. As the population increases, more space for human settlement and life support is required. As a result, people tend to invade the forests and clear them for settlements, farming, charcoal burning and firewood fetching. Then there is the challenge of global warming.

Tanzania is endowed with many power and energy sources, which have not been yet harnessed due to lack of capital.  \nTraining of skilled personnel: More young Tanzanians should be trained on HEP and biogas exploration and production.'
 'Tanzania benefits a lot from its natural gas resources. The resources benefit the economy of the country but also improve the lives of its people. Natural gas has contributed to the improvement of infrastructure. Transport and communication systems to and from source of natural gas areas have been improved. For example, the discovery and extraction of gas in Mtwara Region has stimulated improvement of the airport and the harbour in the region. As a result, air transport to and from Mtwara Region has also improved. Natural gas has also created the demand for labour, goods and services. There has been an increase in the demand for both skilled and unskilled labour to work in the mines and carry out mining-related activities. Moreover, natural gas extraction has added a source of income for the people. Companies involved in natural gas extraction usually pay taxes and other dues to the government. People living nearby natural gas extraction fields also benefit by selling goods,'
 'In Tanzania, natural gas is found in the southern parts of the country, particularly in Mtwara, Lindi, and Ruvuma regions. Specifically, natural gas is produced at Songosongo, Mnazi Bay, Msimbati, Kiliwani North, and Ntorya. Furthermore, exploration of natural gas and petroleum is going on in Tanzania and there are signs of their availability in other coastal regions and islands of Tanzania. In recent years, the exploration has indicated the availability of petroleum and natural gas in Pemba – Zanzibar.  \nThe major producers of petroleum and natural gas in the world include USA, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Russia, Nigeria, Gabon, Libya, Kuwait, Algeria, Angola, Venezuela, Mexico, and Egypt.'

21,please I need a short answer question on post-harvest processing of tea for my students to answer in geography form 2,What are the steps involved in the post-harvest processing of tea according to the provided context in Geography Form 2?,"['#### Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation of tea:  \nIt takes two years for tea plants to be ready for harvesting. Picking of tea leaves requires experience because if it is done poorly, it may result in low-quality tea. Tea plants are normally plucked for 3-4 years after which all old branches are pruned for new shoots to grow. The plucked tea leaves undergo fermentation under regulated moisture to ensure quality tea product. Thereafter, tea leaves are rolled to enhance the breakup of the leaf cells and fibres. The leaves are then dried in temperatures of about 105°C. This process is called roasting or firing. Roasting stops fermentation and reduces moisture. Cool and dried tea is sorted in different sizes and graded. Unwanted particles are removed before packing. At this stage, tea is ready for consumption and export. Figure 2.6 shows the plucking of tea leaves in Iringa.  \nFigure 2.6 Tea plucking in Mufindi, Iringa  \nSource: Tea production...ratetea.com'
 '### Tea:  \nTea is a plant whose leaves are used for making a beverage. In Tanzania, tea is mainly grown in Mbeya, Iringa, Njombe, Kagera, Kilimanjaro, and Tanga regions. Other major tea growing countries in the world are Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, China, Sri-Lanka, India, Indonesia, and Argentina.'
 '#### Harvesting, processing and transportation of sisal:  \nHarvesting of sisal begins when the colour of thorns at the tips changes from dark brown to light-brown. The processing of leaves should take place 48 hours after being harvested. Through processing, sisal fibres are obtained whereby the leaves are crushed between rollers and then mechanically scraped. Then the fibres are washed and dried. Drying of fibres is done in the sun or by using drying machines. This is followed by brushing of the dried fibres for straightening as well as polishing. Thereafter, the fibres are graded depending on their length and colour. It is important to ensure cleanliness of the bale. Graded fibres are then packed into bales either manually or by using machines.'
 '#### Farm preparation, planting and caring of tea:  \nFarms for tea growing are prepared by clearing land. The ideal row spacing for tea plantation is 100 – 110 cm with the plant spacing of 65 – 75 cm. This spacing makes it possible to plant 15,000 plants in an acre.  \nTea also needs full shade and protection from other previously planted trees. The trees protect the plants from being affected by wind. In other words, they act as a wind breaker. Tea production is a labour-intensive activity because planting, weeding, picking and processing largely depend on human labour.'
 '#### Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation:  \nHarvesting of coffee berries is done by hand. Only the red ripe berries are picked. Berries are dried in the sun and then are sorted, weighed and transported to the processing mills. Since coffee can easily absorb external odours which can affect its quality, it must be stored in cool, dark, and dry places to ensure freshness.'

22,Can u make a define question about disadvantages of nomadic pastoralism?,Define the disadvantages of nomadic pastoralism as discussed in the textbook.,"['#### Disadvantages of nomadic pastoralism:  \nNomadic pastoralism suffers from lack of processing and storage facilities, hence causing a significant loss of the products. Also, over-grazing under nomadic pastoralism leads to soil erosion. Moreover, the control of diseases is difficult since animals are always on the move, which can affect the health of the animals and lower productivity in the process. For example, there have been cases of loss of large numbers of livestock due to lack of water and pasture. This situation affects the economy of the pastoralists. Furthermore, the practise of nomadic pastoralism tends to cause conflicts as they interfere with crop cultivators’ land. Because of their nomadic nature, many of the pastoralists’ children fail to attend formal education. As such, their periodic movements result in many of these children being denied their right to education and associated opportunities.'
 '#### Advantages of nomadic pastoralism:  \n- Generally, managing livestock using traditional methods under nomadic pastoralism is cheap. It also ensures the availability of food to the family.\n- In addition, indigenous species of cattle such as Zebu, Boran, and Ankole are resistant to diseases.\n- Furthermore, the animals can tolerate walking over long distances and withstanding other environmental hardships such as high temperatures. They can also stay for a long time without water.\n- Likewise, the cattle are cheap to manage in terms of shelter.'
 '#### Characteristics of nomadic pastoralism:  \nThe nomads normally move in groups. These groups are formed through the integration of families or members of a given ethnic group. A group involves a chief or elders who make decisions for the entire group. Indeed, large herd tends to cause overgrazing. Overgrazing is a situation where the number of cattle is greater than the carrying capacity of the grazing land. As a result, overgrazing causes soil erosion, land degradation, and loss of valuable species. Another feature of the nomadic pastoralists is the breeding process, which is uncontrolled. This situation may lead to the spread and outbreak of animal diseases, hence low animal quality and deaths.  \nIn addition, there is poor control of pests and other diseases, which result to poor quality of animal products. Furthermore, nomadic pastoralism takes place where the population is scarce as the animals are grazed in open range, which needs a lot of space.'
 'Nomadic pastoralism involves continual movement of pastoralists with large numbers of animals from place to place in search of pasture and water. People involved in this practice are called nomads or pastoralists. Tribes which practise nomadic pastoralism include the Maasai, Barbaig, Kwavi, and Karamajong. Nomadic pastoralism is mostly practised in sparsely populated areas where the natural vegetation is mainly grass and bushes and, sometimes, scattered trees. In these areas, rainfall is very low and unreliable. The pastoralists follow specific routes in their movements. Figure 2.10 shows a large herd of cattle. The animals kept by pastoralists are a source of food and income through the selling of animals and their products. Major products from animals are meat and milk. The pastoralists spend the money they earn to meet family needs such as buying cereals, paying school fees, and meeting health expenses. In addition, the cattle raised are used for paying bride price and giving gifts'
 'In addition, low capital investment limits the development of the livestock- keeping sector in the country. Also, inadequate land for grazing leads to conflicts between farmers and pastoralists. Nomadic pastoralists, for example, always move from one place to another in search of pasture and water. As a result, they sometimes graze on the farms, hence conflicts arise between them and farmers. With nomadic pastoralism, the animals get tired due to long distances over which they move. Sometimes, the animals get sick and die, thus leading to low production in terms of quality and quantity.  \n##### Ways of solving challenges facing livestock-keeping in Tanzania:'

These activities include agriculture, forestry, mining, and fishing.  \n##### Agriculture:  \nAgriculture is an activity which involves crop cultivation and livestock-keeping. It is the oldest human activity which has been practised by all societies in the world. It provides food for households and raw materials for industries. The type of agriculture practised in a given place is determined by various conditions of the area including climate, water availability, soil characteristics and terrain. It is also influenced by financial resources, infrastructure, technology and conditions of the market.'

25,I need a descriptive question on undisturbed forests for my form two geog class,What factors influence the distribution of forests according to the textbook information provided?,"['### The concept of forest  \nA forest is an extensive area of land mostly covered by trees of different sizes, species and other forms of undergrowth. By 2015, it was estimated that forests covered about 31% of the earth’s surface. Forest distribution on the earth’s surface varies. Such variation is caused by the amount of rainfall available and the length of wet and warm seasons per year. Forests can be absent in some areas even where the climatic conditions allow tree growth. Absence of forests in extensive areas can be caused by actions of human beings and wild animals.'
 '#### Natural forests:  \nA natural forest refers to a collection of trees that have grown naturally. The types of natural forests include equatorial rainforest, tropical monsoon, deciduous, coniferous and mangrove. The natural forests are found in many countries. Figure 4.1 shows the distribution of various world natural forests.'
 '##### Forestry:  \nForestry is a set of practices that involve managing forests for ecological, social, and economic purposes. There are two types of forests: natural and man-made (planted) forests.  \n##### Planted forests:  \nPlanted forests are those in which trees are planted by human beings. They are commonly known as grown trees. The trees may be obtained locally or from other countries. In Tanzania, mahogany and teak are examples of local species whereas pines and eucalyptus are species from other countries. Some examples of planted forests in Tanzania include The Sao Hill forest plantation in Mafinga, Iringa Region and The West Kilimanjaro forest plantation in Kilimanjaro Region.'
 '#### Mangrove forests:  \nMangroves are a collection of salt-tolerant trees and shrubs that grow on estuaries and deltas of tropical and subtropical coastlines. Figure 4.3 shows mangrove forests. Mangroves grow well in places where fresh water mixes with seawater and where sediments are composed of accumulated deposits of mud. Most of the mangroves grow within 30 North and South of the Equator. Only a few of them have adapted to temperate climates.  \nIn Tanzania, mangrove forests cover most of the coast of the Indian Ocean (Dar es Salaam, Tanga, Mtwara, Pwani, and Zanzibar). Many mangrove forests are disturbed by human activities. In Tanzania, the least disturbed mangrove forests are found in the Rufiji Delta. Other countries with mangrove forests include Nigeria, Mozambique, and Madagascar.'
 'Rainfall: The distribution of forests is also influenced by rainfall. Forests thrive well in areas with plenty of rainfall of over 1200 mm throughout the year. The dense equatorial forests have thrived well because of the presence of heavy rainfall that is well distributed throughout the year. In deciduous forest regions, trees that can survive the dry season exist. These trees shed their leaves during the dry season to reduce water loss through transpiration as their means of survival. Relief is another factor that influences the distribution of forests. It determines soil, temperature and vegetation distribution across gradient. Tree distribution varies with altitude. For example, on Mount Kilimanjaro at 1800-3000 m above sea level, forests consist of diverse tree species. At higher altitude (3000 m), alpine heath dominate. Thus, differences in relief are associated with variations in the type of forests.'

 '### Conditions for growing tea:  \nTea grows well in warm to hot temperatures ranging from 15°C to 29°C. However, the temperature should not be below 21°C during the growing period. In addition, it needs high and well-distributed rainfall of about 1,400 mm to 1,750 mm. It also needs frost-free conditions during the growing periods and fertile, deep, well-drained soil able to retain moisture. The soil should also be slightly acidic with little calcium.'

By 2013, the annual power demand increase was between 10 percent and 15 percent. The demand for power and energy is expected to increase because of the new industries that are to be constructed.  \nFunds allocation for exploration: The government is required to allocate adequate funds for exploring other sources of power. Tanzania is endowed with many power and energy sources, which have not been yet harnessed due to lack of capital.  \nTraining of skilled personnel: More young Tanzanians should be trained on HEP and biogas exploration and production.'
 '## Chapter Eight (Sustainable use of power and energy resources)  \n### Introduction  \nPower and energy are important for every aspect of human life. They may be generated from waves, winds, waterfalls, solar, natural gases, geothermo, oil and coal. In this chapter, you will learn about the major sources of power, the methods of acquiring and extracting power and energy, and the uses of power and energy resources. You will also learn about the problems facing power and energy production, specifically solar and wind power production in the USA, hydroelectric and biogas production in Tanzania. Finally, you will learn about problems related to power and energy extraction in the USA and Tanzania.'
 'In Tanzania, the government puts emphasis on the use of alternative energy, especially for domestic use. It also stresses the use of recycled paper charcoal instead of charcoal made from trees. In addition, there has been an increase in the use of solar power, especially where there is no power.'
 'Currently, solar energy is used in different parts of Tanzania. Solar thermal is used for heating and drying; and photovoltaic is used for lighting, water pumps, refrigeration purposes and telecommunication. Solar energy is used mostly in rural areas by about 64% of its people compared to urban areas with only 3.4%. The regions of Lindi, Njombe, Mtwara, Katavi, and Ruvuma lead in the use of solar power electricity in Tanzania.  \nThe advantages of using solar energy is that it is friendly to the environment. However, the technology for utilising and harnessing solar energy is expensive.  \n| Figure 8.2 Solar panels   | Figure 8.3 Geothermal Plant      |\n| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| Source: shuttersstock.com | Source: Free photoon.pixabay.com |'
 '#### Addressing challenges facing solar and wind energy in USA:  \nThe challenges facing solar and wind energy production may hinder the expected harnessing of this potential energy if deliberate efforts are not made to address them.  \nInstallation of wind turbines and solar panels: Solar and wind energy depends very much on the number and quality of wind turbines and solar panels. The higher the quality of gadgets available, the more the amount of energy produced. It is, therefore, advisable to install enough wind turbines and solar panels over a wide area to increase the amount of energy harnessed.  \nResearch: Research on solar and wind energy is likely to find some solutions to many challenges facing the production of energy from wind and the sun. Research may involve studying the behaviour of wind and new technologies for tapping solar energy day and night.'

28,"morning, I need a question for the students to explain process of evaporation",Explain the factors that influence the process of evaporation.,"['### Evaporation  \nEvaporation is the process by which water changes from liquid to gas or vapour. During evaporation, water moves into the atmosphere in the form of water vapour or moisture. Water bodies such as rivers, lakes, seas, and oceans contribute about 90% of the moisture found in the atmosphere through evaporation. Water changes into vapour under the great influence of temperature. Areas with high temperatures and low humidity experience a high rate of evaporation. Evaporation is also determined by humidity and wind.'
 '### Evapotranspiration  \nEvapotranspiration refers to the process whereby water is transferred from the land to the air through plant roots and leaves. Water from the land is carried by roots to the leaves, a process known as transpiration, and then from the leaves it changes into vapour and moves into the atmosphere through the process of evaporation. The combination of these two processes form what is termed as evapotranspiration (Evaporation + transpiration = evapotranspiration). Evapotranspiration is determined by factors such as temperature, humidity, wind, soil, and type of plants. These factors are hereby explained.'
 '#### Temperature:  \nAn increase in temperature accelerates the rate of evaporation. During the warm season, plants open their stomata (pores) and release water in the form of water vapour. During the cold season, plants close their stomata and prohibit the release of water. 10% of the moisture in the atmosphere is contributed by the release of water from plants.  \nFigure 3.2: Evaporation from ocean water  \nFigure 3.3: Evapotranspiration'
 '#### Infiltration:  \nInfiltration, which is sometimes called percolation, is the process whereby water that has reached the ground penetrates into the soil or rocks (Figure 3.6).  \nSome of the water may seep through and go deep underground and create underground runoff or aquifer in the rocks. Water that percolates the land surface is called underground water. Infiltration is an essential process as it feeds water bodies and soils which are sources of evaporation and evapotranspiration.'
 '### Condensation  \nCondensation is the process whereby water in its gaseous form changes into liquid. The moist warm air from water bodies and plants moves upwards where there is very low temperature. Then it reaches a dew point (point at which water condenses) and forms clouds. Clouds are masses of water droplets which continue to accumulate and when they are saturated, they become dense and fall as rain. Condensation is a very essential process in the hydrological cycle because it leads to the formation of clouds which produce rainfall (Figure 3.4). Rainfall is the main route through which water returns to the earth’s surface.  \nFigure 3.4 Heavy clouds in the air\nSource: ruvumapress.blogspot.com-mawingu mazito'

Fertile soil tends to support the growth of vegetation which increases the rate of evapotranspiration. Soil, which supports vegetation, allows much evapotranspiration to take place.'
 'Soil: Soil contributes much to the distribution of forests. In this case, soil type, drainage, texture, permeability, porosity and chemical composition play a significant role in tree growth. For example, soil rich in humus encourages tree growth, which may turn into a forest. Regarding drainage, well-drained soils support a variety of trees whereas poorly drained soils such as swamps or steep slope areas with immature soil cannot support tree growth. For example, coastal tropical areas with sea alluvial salty water attract mangrove forests growth. Also, tropical rainforest trees require deep well-drained soils for proper binding together whereas coniferous trees have fibrous roots which can grow in shallow soils.'
 '(b) Reclamation of land affected by soil erosion differs from land covered by water. Soil affected by erosion calls for planting of trees. Trees will act as binding agents for keeping the soil particles together and absorbing excess water which would otherwise flow rapidly over the land. Moreover, using better methods of agriculture such as contour ploughing, terracing, and strip farming especially in steep slopes helps to prevent erosion.  \n(c) Land may also be reclaimed by restoring its fertility. In this case, land which has lost fertility may require planting cover crops and addition of organic manure and fertilisers to improve its fertility. The fertility will attract vegetation growth. Vegetation will not only bind the soil but also protect it from excessive loss of water through transpiration.  \n(d) Land affected by excessive animal keeping can be restored by reducing the number of animals in the area.

These activities include agriculture, forestry, mining, and fishing.  \n##### Agriculture:  \nAgriculture is an activity which involves crop cultivation and livestock-keeping. It is the oldest human activity which has been practised by all societies in the world. It provides food for households and raw materials for industries. The type of agriculture practised in a given place is determined by various conditions of the area including climate, water availability, soil characteristics and terrain. It is also influenced by financial resources, infrastructure, technology and conditions of the market.'
 '#### Advantages of small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop production is cheap to operate since it involves the use of simple farming tools such as hand hoes and machetes. It is also cheap because the sources of labour are family members and, hence, easy to manage. In addition, small-scale agriculture needs small capital since it operates on small pieces of land. This type of agriculture when integrated with livestock-keeping provides biomass which is useful in the production of biogas energy. This energy is commonly used for cooking. Another advantage of small-scale crop cultivation is that farmers get fresh food such as vegetables and fruits. Therefore, small-scale agriculture contributes to the development of local communities.'

Residue from planting processed kernels can be used as animal fodder and manure.'
 '### Oil palm:  \nOil palm is a plant grown in tropical areas specifically for producing palm oil. It is grown on both small-scale on farm lots and large-scale on plantations. In Tanzania palm oil is grown in Kigoma and Mbeya regions. Other palm oil growing countries in the world are Malaysia, Nigeria, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.'
 '#### Harvesting, processing, storage, and transportation of oil palm:  \nThe fruits of the palm oil trees turn red when they are ripe and ready for harvesting. Each fruit consists of a fleshy pericarp surrounding a nut. Fruits are boiled in pots or drums at high temperature. The processing continues to the point where the pericarp is compressed to obtain palm oil. Inside the pericarp, there is a kernel which is also a source of oil. Oil from the kernel is obtained by crushing the nuts in a grinder and compressing them. The extracted palm oil is packed in containers ready for domestic use and export.'
 '#### Conditions necessary for growing oil palm:  \nOil palm grows well in areas with high temperatures throughout the year with mean monthly temperature of over 21°C, heavy rainfall throughout the year (about 1,500 mm to 2,040 mm), and needs a well-drained soil to enable water to pass through.'
 '#### Uses of cloves:  \nCloves can be used in the production of oil which is used in dentistry, sanitary applications and as medicine. They also serve as a spice in food.

32,can you make a short question about categories of manufacturing,What are the two main types of manufacturing industries?,"['### Types of manufacturing industries  \nManufacturing industries can be grouped into two main types, namely, processing and fabrication industries.'
 '### The concept of manufacturing industry  \nThe manufacturing industry involves the processing and changing of raw materials into different semi-finished or finished products using tools and machines. It plays a major role in bringing about the development of a country. The ever-growing population with increased demands for goods and services is accommodated by the establishment of manufacturing industries. Such increased population demands more food, shelter, clothes and other services. The following section explains the importance of manufacturing industries in the world.'
 '### The importance of manufacturing industries:  \n- (a) Manufacturing industries are sources of employment for both skilled and unskilled labour. These employees can raise their standards of living and improve quality of life with the income they earn. The income they earn caters for basic needs such as food, shelter, clothes and education.\n- (b) Manufacturing industries also lead to the diversification of the country’s economy due to their potentials for promoting other sectors of the economy. This reduces over-dependence on one or two economic sectors, which can be affected by fluctuation of prices in the world market.\n- (c) Manufacturing industries enable countries to process locally produced raw materials before they are exported. This process helps to add value to the exports.'
 '- (d) Manufacturing industries stimulate the development of infrastructure such as railways and roads. These means of transport are useful in carrying raw materials to manufacturing centers and the finished or unfinished goods to the markets.\n- (e) Industries also help to create a large internal market as workers get wages and salaries from industries which enable them to buy goods and services. In fact, the more the workers, the larger the market for manufacturing industries.\n- (f) Manufacturing industries also lead to increased agricultural production. For example, the textile industry requires cotton as raw material. Thus, it can stimulate the expansion of cotton growing.\n- (g) Manufacturing industries are sources of foreign currency. The products manufactured in a country are exported to other countries for sale which, in turn, attract foreign currency.'
 '#### Types of manufacturing industries in East Africa:  \nThere are different types of manufacturing industries in East Africa. They can be grouped as follows:\ni. Food and beverage industries\nii. Chemical industries\niii. Textile industries\niv. Mineral extraction industries\nv. Iron and steel industries: They make iron and steel bars, wires, and other iron and steel products.\nvi. Lumbering industries: These industries deal with the production of timber, wood pulp and other products from wood. Paper industries rely on softwood which grows fast.\nvii.

33,Please i need an explaining question for the effects of population growth on subsistence farming.,How does rapid population growth impact small-scale crop cultivation in terms of land use patterns and living standards for farmers?,"['#### Relationship between population growth and small-scale crop production:  \nPopulation growth is an increase in the number of people in a particular area. Rapid population growth could be due to natural increase or in-migration. The rapid population growth puts more pressure on small-scale farmers. Yet, subsistence farmers are not likely to raise their output to feed the growing numbers because of lack of capital. Subsequently, land becomes overpopulated and resources overused. Also high population growth is associated with smaller farms and lower farm wages. As a result households in densely populated areas increasingly rely on off-farm income.'
 'The resulting population growth affects land use patterns. This may cause shortage of food and poor living standards. The solution to this problem is to improve small-scale crop cultivation. The government and other organisations should help farmers by providing them with education and capital to make subsistence agriculture more intensive and more productive. Moreover, the government, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and co-operative societies should help the farmers to select better seeds, use proper insecticides, pesticides, and apply fertilisers properly. In addition, they should help in providing transport to make sure the products reach proper storage places and markets. Furthermore, the government should emphasise and support the opening of joint agriculture ventures, finding of markets for surplus products and establishing good storage facilities. Additionally, deliberate efforts should be made to provide education on good farming practises, for example, the use of simple'
 '#### Effects of rapid population growth on small-scale crop cultivation:  \nOverpopulation does not depend merely on the total number of people living in an area, or on the population density. It depends much on the available resources in a given area. When an area has more people than it can support to give them a reasonable standard of living, the area will suffer from overpopulation or population pressure. If the area has inhabitants who are too few to develop the resources available to improve living conditions, then the area suffers from under-population.'
 '## Chapter Two (Agriculture)  \n### Introduction  \nIn this chapter, you will learn about the meaning and types of agriculture, the effects of rapid population growth on small-scale agriculture, characteristics of small-scale agriculture, advantages and disadvantages of small-scale agriculture, and ways of improving small-scale agriculture.

Finally, you will learn about the various types of livestock keeping practices as well as their benefits and constraints by focusing on Tanzania and Australia.'
 '#### Small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop cultivation is the growing of crops on a small piece of land. It is also called subsistence farming. It aims to produce enough food for the wellbeing of families. In some instances, when the production is high, the surplus is sold. Individuals engaging in small-scale crop cultivation are known as peasants. They are also called subsistence farmers as they grow food crops to feed themselves and their families with little or no surplus for sale.  \nAs noted earlier, the agricultural system at subsistence level falls under this category. A farmer owns a small piece of land for food crops cultivation. The produce is enough only for the family. It is hand to mouth existence which may lead to famine if the harvest is bad. In years with good harvest the farmer may have surplus to sell to the local markets. The farms are small, about one to five hectares owned by the family. Application of machines is difficult as farms are small.'

34,please can you make a true or false question about undisturbed forests,True or False: Destruction of animal habitats is not a challenge to the forestry industry.,"['### The concept of forest  \nA forest is an extensive area of land mostly covered by trees of different sizes, species and other forms of undergrowth. By 2015, it was estimated that forests covered about 31% of the earth’s surface. Forest distribution on the earth’s surface varies. Such variation is caused by the amount of rainfall available and the length of wet and warm seasons per year. Forests can be absent in some areas even where the climatic conditions allow tree growth. Absence of forests in extensive areas can be caused by actions of human beings and wild animals.'
 '#### Natural forests:  \nA natural forest refers to a collection of trees that have grown naturally. The types of natural forests include equatorial rainforest, tropical monsoon, deciduous, coniferous and mangrove. The natural forests are found in many countries. Figure 4.1 shows the distribution of various world natural forests.'
 'Destruction of animal habitats is also a challenge to the forestry industry. Cutting down, burning and over-exploitation of trees destroy the homes of animals and soil organisms. Some animals may migrate to other less favourable and inhospitable areas only to die there. This act may lead to forest extinction due to the absence of animals and other organisms that matter to the eco-system by keeping the forest soil fertile. Besides, destroying forest habitats may lead to scarcity of forest products such as trees of medicinal value, and honey.'
 '#### Characteristics of a deciduous forest  \nDeciduous forests have characteristics that distinguish them from other types of forests. They contain trees with broad leaves. Trees in these forests usually shed their leaves in autumn and they remain leafless throughout the cold winters to minimize loss of water by transpiration. Deciduous forests are composed of a mixture of various tree species. Deciduous forest trees include oak, elm, chestnut, maple, willow, ash, and beech.'
 '##### Forestry:  \nForestry is a set of practices that involve managing forests for ecological, social, and economic purposes. There are two types of forests: natural and man-made (planted) forests.  \n##### Planted forests:  \nPlanted forests are those in which trees are planted by human beings. They are commonly known as grown trees. The trees may be obtained locally or from other countries. In Tanzania, mahogany and teak are examples of local species whereas pines and eucalyptus are species from other countries. Some examples of planted forests in Tanzania include The Sao Hill forest plantation in Mafinga, Iringa Region and The West Kilimanjaro forest plantation in Kilimanjaro Region.'

 '#### Disadvantages of small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop cultivation is associated with loss of soil fertility due to overuse of the same plots of land. Moreover, the practice of burning vegetation during farm preparation tends to destroy soil nutrients, hence lower its fertility. As a result, subsistence or peasant farmers’ yields tend to fall. Such low yields are also contributed by low use of fertilisers and pesticides. Therefore, various ways are needed to reduce the challenges of small-scale crop cultivation.'

 '#### Infiltration:  \nInfiltration, which is sometimes called percolation, is the process whereby water that has reached the ground penetrates into the soil or rocks (Figure 3.6).  \nSome of the water may seep through and go deep underground and create underground runoff or aquifer in the rocks. Water that percolates the land surface is called underground water. Infiltration is an essential process as it feeds water bodies and soils which are sources of evaporation and evapotranspiration.'

 'Also, the remains of forest trees including foliage contribute to soil development through decomposition into organic matter, leading to formation of humus. Soil in the forest is very fertile due to humus from decomposed plant remains. Solar energy helps plants to manufacture their own food through photosynthesis. Plants are eaten by herbivores; likewise, herbivores are consumed by carnivores who feed on meat. When they all die, their remains are decomposed by bacteria which break down dead matter and release nutrients into the soil. Therefore, forests have input in the food chain. Tree canopies control the evaporation of water from the soil beneath, hence allow more retention of water in the soil. The canopies also enable recharging of ground water by controlling over land flow after rainfall. In addition, forest trees contribute to water vapour in the atmosphere which is important in regulating atmospheric conditions. The humidity in the atmosphere is important in the rain formation'

Solar and wind energy in USA is important in so many ways.  \nEnvironmentally-friendly: The production of solar and wind energy involves activities which produce less waste in the environment compared to other sources of energy. These energies, therefore, are considered to be environmentally-friendly. For example, their production reduces the emission of carbon-dioxide and other pollutants.  \nCreation of employment opportunities: Installation and management of solar panels and wind mills require many employees. This industry generates jobs for thousands of people.'
 'Renewable energy sources: Renewable energy is any energy source that is naturally replaced. The energy can be derived from sunlight, tides, wind, water, geothermal, or hydroelectric action. Likewise, energy produced from the refining of various forms of biomass is often classified as renewable. The renewable energy sources are usually regarded as environmentally friendly because they release few chemicals that can harm the environment. These are energy resources that are naturally reused. Renewable sources are sustainable if they are carefully managed and maintained. They have minimal negative effects on the environment. Renewable energy sources include sunlight, geothermal heat, wind, tides, water, and various forms of biomass. Some of these energy sources are described in the following sub-sections.'
 'Renewable and non-renewable energy: Renewable energy is energy generated from sources that are essentially inexhaustible. Examples of renewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, geothermal energy, tidal power, and hydroelectric power. Non-renewable energy includes conventional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which are likely to get depleted with use.  \nConventional and non-conventional energy: Conventional energy is an energy source which is fixed in nature like oil, gas, coal, and hydropower generation. It is also termed as non-renewable energy or thermal energy. The conventional energy resources are being used extensively; as a result, their known reserves have been depleted to a great extent. The use of conventional energy has emerging effects on the environment. The non-conventional energy involves energy generated by wind, tides, solar and biomass. These are renewable sources of energy and not exhaustible.'
 '### Solar and wind energy harnessing in USA  \nUSA is one of the leading countries in the world harnessing energy from the Sun. Before 2008, much of the electricity was generated from other sources such as fossil fuel and HEP. By 2018, solar power accounted for 1.44 percent of the total USA electricity, generating about 58.9 terawatt-hours (TWH).  \nUSA needs energy that is secure, reliable, protective of the environment, and able to address climate change, create jobs and improve public health. USA reduced the use of fossil fuel as a source of energy because it is expensive and not renewable. The American Government reduces the cost of solar power and increases the cost of fossil fuel to encourage use of the former. USA, as a highly developed country in terms of technology and economy, has a very high demand for power and energy for industrial and domestic use.'

38,Please I need a short question about additional water resources for form 2 students,"What is water resource management, and why is it important for sustainable development?","['Water resource management refers to the process of planning, developing, distributing and managing the effective use of water resources. In today’s interconnected world, there is no doubt about the value of integrated planning for sustainable development. There is a need to have an integrated water resources management that supports the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. Integrated Water Resources Management is one of the initiatives for sustainable use of water resources, and it refers to a process of promoting the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources, in order to maximise the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems. The management helps to protect the environment, foster economic growth and sustainable agricultural development, promote democratic participation in governance, and improve human health.'
 '### Sources of water  \nThere are several sources of water. These include rainfall, wells, springs, ponds, rivers, lakes, seas and oceans. There are various ways used to manage water resources. These are policies, laws, regulations, and awareness raising campaigns.'
 '### The concept of water management  \nWater is a colourless liquid found naturally on the land surface, atmosphere, and underground reservoirs. Water can exist in liquid, solid, or gas state. Although water is a familiar substance, it is also a unique material of the earth. For a long time, water has been considered to be an abundant resource which is found freely to all people. Today, most countries are facing increasing pressure on water resources and growing competition between differing interests. Chronic water scarcity is perceived to be one of the threats to global prosperity and stability. Other threats include hydrological uncertainty and extreme weather disasters such as floods and droughts.'
 'Access to water is fundamental to economic and social development. However, population growth, rapid urbanisation and industrialisation, the expansion of agriculture and tourism, and climate change all put water under increasing stress. This situation has impacted negatively the socio-economic development of most developing countries. As a result, at the global level, there is a major concern regarding the management of water resources. Water resources management emerged as a response to real and foreseen water crises and increasingly unsustainable pressure on the freshwater resources, which emanate from rising populations, growing demands for water due to competing water uses, and increasing pollution.'

They prefer well distributed rainfall, which is ideal for flowering. In this regard, the annual rainfall should range from 1,500 mm – 2,500 mm. In addition, cloves require deep loamy soils with high humus content and well-drained black loam soils of semi-forest regions. Cloves need good drainage and prefer partial shade and a cooler climate.'
 '### Clove:  \nClove is an evergreen tree of humid tropical climate (Figure 2.8). Its flower buds are spices used in food, drinks and medicine. The clove was introduced in Zanzibar in the United Republic of Tanzania in the first half of the 19th century from Indonesia. Clove growing in Zanzibar started with plantations but it has progressively been fragmented into smaller holdings of about 3 acres. The prominent clove growing countries in the world are Indonesia, India and Madagascar. Indonesia is the biggest grower, importer and consumer of cloves.'
 '#### Uses of cloves:  \nCloves can be used in the production of oil which is used in dentistry, sanitary applications and as medicine. They also serve as a spice in food. Moreover, cloves add flavor in tea and cigarettes. Cloves are a cash crop that is sold to earn foreign currency.  \nTable 2.1 shows major cash crops grown in Tanzania.  \n##### Table 2.1 Major cash crops grown in Tanzania  \n| Crop           | Areas                                                       |\n| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Coffee         | Kagera, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Mbeya, Ruvuma, Kigoma and Mara |\n| Cotton         | Mwanza, Tabora, Mara, Tanga, Shinyanga, Geita and Simiyu    |\n| Palm oil trees | Kigoma                                                      |\n| Tea            | Mbeya, Iringa, Njombe, Tanga, Kilimanjaro and Kagera        |\n| Sisal          | Tanga, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Morogoro, Lindi and Mtwara      |'
 '#### Harvesting, processing and transportation of cloves:  \nClove trees can grow up to 15 meters high. Therefore, harvesting involves picking of flower buds which is done by climbing or scaling.\nHarvesting is done by hand by skilled climbers. In Zanzibar, the harvesting occurs from September to November.\nSorting is necessary to separate leaves from the buds. The buds and flowers are left to dry in the sun for 3 - 7 days.\nTo ensure quality, the dirty and unwanted particles are removed from the dried cloves. The Zanzibar State Trading Corporation (ZSTC) is an organ responsible for buying and exporting cloves from the Isles in Tanzania to major importers such as Taiwan, India, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.'

40,"Hello, please provide a short definition exercise about issues in livestock farming for my class.",Define one challenge facing livestock-keeping as described in the textbook.,"['#### Challenges facing livestock-keeping:  \nLivestock-keeping faces a number of challenges. Climatic changes resulting in prolonged drought may lead to a shortage of water and pasture which may cause animal deaths. In tropical conditions, animals are infected by tsetse flies, causing nagana disease. There are also diseases such as East Coast Fever, Rift Valley Fever (RVF), Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD). Inadequate financial capital government for investing in commercial livestock farming is another challenge.'
 'Livestock-keeping is affected by poor transportation for animal products from farms to markets because some areas are inaccessible. In some cases, pastoralists suffer because of unreliable markets and poor storage facilities. As a result of poor transportation networking, especially due to poor and inaccessible roads, their animal-based products get spoiled before reaching the market. However, the market is very limited because of the low purchasing power of the people in some areas. Thislowpurchasingpoweraffectsthe income of livestock-keepers and, as a result, they fail to purchase vaccines for the growth and health of animals. Moreover, insufficient availability of seminars and training on modern livestock-keeping methods lead to low production. In some areas, animals are kept traditionally due to low-level of technology. The changing climate further compromises the availability of water and pasture for the animals.'
 'Diseases may also increase due to changes in weather and climatic conditions. In addition, the establishment of cattle and sheep keeping in most cases have resulted in negative environmental impacts. The livestock industry is also a major source of land degradation, water pollution, in addition to being a driver of deforestation. It also faces a shortage of skilled labour. This type of labour is characterised by higher education and expertise levels obtained through training and experience. Such expertise also demands higher salaries. The shortage of such highly skilled labour force can hinder operations in the livestock industries, hence reduce productivity and lower the national income. Furthermore, improper transport, processing and shippinginfrastructurereducethequality of the livestock products.'
 '#### Economic importance of livestock-keeping:'
 '#### Challenges facing livestock-keeping in Tanzania  \nPrevalence of pests and diseases affects animals’ health and, eventually, causes low or poor production. Also, over-grazing causes shortage of water, pasture and soil erosion. There is also a problem of poor transportation of livestock and livestock products from one place to another. In addition, low level of technology to improve the animal breeds as well as preserve animal products has been another limitation in the development of livestock-keeping in the country. These challenges lead to low quality and productivity. The low livestock production in turn, lowers the quality of life of livestock-keepers and affects development generally. Lack of reliable markets is a serious threat to the sustainability of the livestock-keeping sector.'

 '### Focal studies  \n#### Oil production in the Middle East  \nThe Middle East is one of the leading oil-producing areas in the world. The major oil-producing countries in the area include Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.  \nFigure 5.4 shows major oil fields in the Middle East.  \nThese countries contribute one-third of the total oil production in the world. These countries are members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). They play a big role in deciding world oil prices. The main consumers of oil from the Middle East are Western Europe, Japan, USA, Canada, and Australia. The Middle East exports about 70 percent of crude oil in the world.'
 '#### Importance of oil production to Middle East countries:  \nThe Middle East is located in an arid region. Oil production has contributed to economic and social development of the Middle East countries. The countries depend greatly on the exportation of petroleum and petroleum products to earn foreign currency. Companies involved in oil production in most of the Middle East countries are mostly state-owned. However, there are also some oil fields run by private companies. These companies pay taxes to the government. The revenue from oil refining and support industries is used to provide social services such as education and health. The revenue is also used in the construction and improvement of infrastructure such as roads, railways, and airports. Jobs are also created in areas that produce oil as many people in the Middle East work in the petroleum refineries and petrochemical industries.'
 'Oil production in the Middle East has stimulated the improvement of the transport sector. The export of petroleum and petroleum products has enabled Middle East countries to develop good transport networks. In addition, petroleum is a resource which provides energy and power for domestic and industrial purposes.'
 'Oil production in the Middle East faces many challenges. With rising global demand, highly volatile prices are increasingly becoming stringent. The oil and gas industry faces three major challenges involving how to reduce costs, optimize the performance of its industrial base assets, and address its environmental footprint. Environmental pollution is one of these challenges. Oil refinery and production of petroleum products produce carbon dioxide and other gases such as methane which are harmful. As countries in the Middle East have large oil production industries, the emission of harmful gases is also high. These gases contribute to the pollution of water, air, and land. Burning fossil fuels produces sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. When they move into the atmosphere they produce acid rain, which damages buildings and vegetation in addition to affecting fish and other organisms that live in water. Another challenge facing oil production in the Middle East has to do with civil wars'

These activities include agriculture, forestry, mining, and fishing.  \n##### Agriculture:  \nAgriculture is an activity which involves crop cultivation and livestock-keeping. It is the oldest human activity which has been practised by all societies in the world. It provides food for households and raw materials for industries. The type of agriculture practised in a given place is determined by various conditions of the area including climate, water availability, soil characteristics and terrain. It is also influenced by financial resources, infrastructure, technology and conditions of the market.'
 '#### Secondary activities  \nSecondary activities are subsidiary as they are performed in addition to primary activities. They involve processing products obtained from primary activities. Occupations which produce finished goods using the products of primary activities.'
 'Primary and secondary energy: Primary energy sources are those that are either found or stored in nature. This type of energy is captured directly from natural resources. Common primary energy sources are coal, oil, natural gas, and biomass (such as wood). Other primary energy sources include available nuclear energy from radioactive substances, thermal energy stored in the earth’s interior, and potential energy due to earth’s gravity. The primary energy sources are converted into secondary energy sources; for example coal, oil or gas are converted into steam and electricity. Also, heat is a primary energy, which can be transformed into secondary geothermal or solar electricity.'
 '- National gross domestic product: The mining industry contributes to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). For example, mining and quarrying activities in Tanzania contributed about 4% to its GDP in 2015.\n- Raw materials: Minerals provide raw materials for various industries. For example, gypsum is used as a raw material in cement industries.\n- Social services: Mining stimulates the development of settlements. The establishment of settlements in or near mining centers forces the government to provide social services such as health, and education. In addition, the development of settlements around mining centers has contributed to the growth of some towns such as Mwadui, Kahama, Geita, and Mererani.\n- Infrastructure: Mining stimulates the construction of roads to and from mining centers. For example, Kahama road networks were constructed due to gold mining. Similarly, Mwadui roads were built because of diamond mining.'
 '- (d) Manufacturing industries stimulate the development of infrastructure such as railways and roads. These means of transport are useful in carrying raw materials to manufacturing centers and the finished or unfinished goods to the markets.\n- (e) Industries also help to create a large internal market as workers get wages and salaries from industries which enable them to buy goods and services. In fact, the more the workers, the larger the market for manufacturing industries.\n- (f) Manufacturing industries also lead to increased agricultural production. For example, the textile industry requires cotton as raw material. Thus, it can stimulate the expansion of cotton growing.\n- (g) Manufacturing industries are sources of foreign currency. The products manufactured in a country are exported to other countries for sale which, in turn, attract foreign currency.'

 'Small-scale crop cultivation is done by using different methods such as shifting cultivation, crop rotation, and bush fallowing.'
 'Agriculture can be done by individual farmers, companies, or co-operative societies. Crop farming is the type of agriculture that involves the cultivation of land to produce crops. Crop farming can be practised to produce food crops and cash crops.  \nFood crops include rice, beans, cassava, maize, wheat, bananas, and potatoes whereas cash crops include sisal, coffee, tea, and cashew-nuts. Figure 1.1 shows a rice paddy.  \nFigure 1.1 Rice paddy  \nSource: Mwakalinga 03 June 2016: ippmedia.com'
 '#### Disadvantages of small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop cultivation is associated with loss of soil fertility due to overuse of the same plots of land. Moreover, the practice of burning vegetation during farm preparation tends to destroy soil nutrients, hence lower its fertility. As a result, subsistence or peasant farmers’ yields tend to fall. Such low yields are also contributed by low use of fertilisers and pesticides. Therefore, various ways are needed to reduce the challenges of small-scale crop cultivation.'
 '### The concept of agriculture  \nAgriculture is a science which deals with crop cultivation and livestock keeping.

 '#### Negative impact of tourism:  \nThe negative impact of tourism includes the following:  \nTourism has sometimes led to cultural interference and conflicts. Sometimes tourists bring with them practices that are unacceptable to the people in the host country, for example, ways of dressing, food style, and language. Moral decay has occurred in places that are visited by tourists. For example, cases of prostitution, same-sex relationships (homosexuality), and drug abuse have become common in areas with tourist attractions such as beaches and nightclubs.  \nIn addition, tourist activities in national parks and other protected areas may lead to environmental degradation such as off road driving and dumping of waste such as paper and plastics.  \nMoreover, the continued presence of people and vehicles in the tourists sites may lead to change in animal behaviours.'

Over-exploitation of forest resources is one of the challenges. Forest resources are harvested to the point of reducing their ability to regenerate. For example, some forest tree species, especially natural trees, are usually in high demand. The demand compels over-harvesting of such forest resources so much so that they face extinction. In some cases, forests are harvested without following governing procedures and, consequently, some tree species may disappear. Experience indicates that ungoverned exploitation is usually serious in public-owned natural forests than in private planted forests. Forests also face the problem of fire outbreaks with some fires occurring naturally while others are set by people. The fire, particularly during late burning, destroys trees and the undergrowth, which are the main constituents of forests. Estimates indicate that each year fires burn'
 'Source of energy: Forests provide firewood and charcoal which are used as sources of energy in the households. Wood energy provides 9% of the global primary energy supply, making it the most important source of bioenergy in the world. In some parts of Africa, fuel wood is the most affordable source of energy and it accounts for about 90% of primary energy consumption.  \nEmployment: Individuals are employed in the forestry sector as forest officers and forest guards. Others are employed as lumberers while some are self-employed in carpentry and joinery, and others are timber merchants who buy and sell timber. Forest industries provide formal employment to 0.4% of the global labour force, contributing to nearly 1% of global GDP in 2008.'
 'which are the main constituents of forests. Estimates indicate that each year fires burn 6-14 million hectares of forests around the world. Construction of different infrastructure for social and economic support is a challenge to the forestry industry. Different construction activities lead to the devastation of forests. For example, the construction of dams, roads and railway lines forces the clearing of some forest hectares. In addition, population increase presents another challenge to the forestry industry. As the population increases, more space for human settlement and life support is required. As a result, people tend to invade the forests and clear them for settlements, farming, charcoal burning and firewood fetching. Then there is the challenge of global warming. Global warming results from the accumulation of harmful gases in the atmosphere. In this case, the gases destroy the ozone layer and makes some trees in the forest wither and dry after failing to withstand the'
 'Human beings obtain various products and services from forests. Forest products can be timber and non-timber products that help to sustain human life. Non-timber forest products include fruits, honey, leaves, roots and barks. The process of managing forest resources for human use is known as forestry. Foresters engage in lumbering, which is an activity that involves cutting, transporting, processing and selling timber. The terms ‘timber’ and ‘log’ are used interchangeably to mean branches or pieces of the trunk of a tree, but with the bark attached. Harvesting of forest resources is generally sustainable when there is no or little damage to the general environment. A forest can be natural or planted. Animals, birds and insects use forests to support their lives. Forests provide aesthetic value and services to human beings.'
 '##### Forestry:  \nForestry is a set of practices that involve managing forests for ecological, social, and economic purposes. There are two types of forests: natural and man-made (planted) forests.  \n##### Planted forests:  \nPlanted forests are those in which trees are planted by human beings. They are commonly known as grown trees. The trees may be obtained locally or from other countries. In Tanzania, mahogany and teak are examples of local species whereas pines and eucalyptus are species from other countries.

 '#### Conditions for growing cloves:  \nCloves require a humid tropical climate with annual average temperatures of between 20°C and 30°C. They prefer well distributed rainfall, which is ideal for flowering. In this regard, the annual rainfall should range from 1,500 mm – 2,500 mm. In addition, cloves require deep loamy soils with high humus content and well-drained black loam soils of semi-forest regions. Cloves need good drainage and prefer partial shade and a cooler climate.'
 '#### Farm preparation, planting and care of cloves:  \nClove seeds are sown at 2 cm to 3 cm spacing wip a depp of about 2 cm.\nThe germinated seedlings are transplanted in bags. The seed-beds have to be protected from direct sunlight.\nThe young plants are left for almost 2 years. Then the seedlings are transplanted in the field at the spacing of 6 to 7 meters apart.'

The noises can also affect hearing in human beings, and may also disturb people living near the industries, by disrupting their sleep and rest.'
 '### Pollutants from manufacturing industries:  \nIndustrial pollutants are substances that make air, water and soil harmful to living organisms. The manufacturing industries produce different pollutants which are dangerous to human health and the environment. These pollutants are categorized as gas, solids, liquids and noise.'
 'Noise and aesthetic pollution: Wind power plants may produce unwanted noise from turbine blades. They may also disturb the visual aspect of the landscape. However, compared to other conventional power plants, they have relatively less negative impact on the environment.'
 '- Effects of the mining industry on the environment: Mining and processing activities have negative effects on the environment if not done carefully. The sections below describe some of the effects of mining on the environment.\n- Pollution: Mining activities can lead to water, air, and noise pollution. To begin with, mining produces waste materials which pollute water bodies. For example, chemicals used in processing minerals such as mercury and sodium cyanide can pollute rivers, lakes, and underground water. This may cause the loss of life of living organisms, which depend on water. Large amounts of dust released into the air affect people, plants, and animals found in nearby areas. Also, the blasting process causes noise and vibration which affect people and their properties in nearby areas.'
 '### Major ways of reducing industrial pollution  \nThere are several ways of reducing pollution from industries. These ways include the following.  \n- (a) Locating industries away from residential areas. There should be a proper policy on locating industries.\n- (b) Laws and by-laws should be enacted to protect the environment against pollution.\n- (c) Encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy which are environmental friendly, for example, the use of solar energy and hydro-electric power.\n- (d) Complete combustion of fuels in industrial machines should be ensured as it reduces air pollution.\n- (e) Liquid waste from industries should be treated before it is discharged as waste, to reduce the effects on the environment.\n- (f) Industrial waste can be reduced through re-use and recycling of plastic materials, bottles and cans to produce other materials.\n- (g) Routine inspection and maintenance of industrial machines should be carried out on a regular basis.'

0,pls i need a short question about problems in getting energy in Tanzania for my students to answer,"What are some of the challenges facing power and energy harnessing in Tanzania, particularly during the dry season?","['### Challenges to harnessing power and energy in Tanzania:  \nPower and energy harnessing in Tanzania faces various challenges ranging from naturally occurring to human-made ones. The following are some of the challenges facing power and energy harnessing in Tanzania.  \nFluctuation of river volume: In the dry season, rain may be scarce or completely absent which reduces water in dams and, consequently, lowers the generation of HEP. Tanzania has been experiencing periods of power-cut particularly during the dry season because of over-dependence on HEP.'
 '### Addressing challenges to power and energy harnessing in Tanzania:  \nDespite the challenges to harnessing power and energy, the following are some of the solutions to the challenges facing power and energy harnessing in Tanzania.  \nAlternative sources of power: Alternative sources of power to support the existing sources should be explored to meet the increasing power demand in Tanzania. By 2013, the annual power demand increase was between 10 percent and 15 percent. The demand for power and energy is expected to increase because of the new industries that are to be constructed.  \nFunds allocation for exploration: The government is required to allocate adequate funds for exploring other sources of power. Tanzania is endowed with many power and energy sources, which have not been yet harnessed due to lack of capital.  \nTraining of skilled personnel: More young Tanzanians should be trained on HEP and biogas exploration and production.'
 'In Tanzania, the government puts emphasis on the use of alternative energy, especially for domestic use. It also stresses the use of recycled paper charcoal instead of charcoal made from trees. In addition, there has been an increase in the use of solar power, especially where there is no power.'
 '### Importance of HEP and biogas energy resources in Tanzania  \nTanzania’s major electrical energy is obtained primarily from HEP followed by natural gas. These energy sources are important to the economy of the country. HEP and biogas energy are important in many ways.  \nUse at the local level: Production of biogas requires simple technology, which can be handled by any interested person. Based on technological simplicity, biogas is prominent at local levels in Tanzania.  \nWaste management: Use of biogas enhances management of wastes mainly animal dung. All animal dung around people’s homes is collected and ferried to the processing area to produce power. People with many livestock find biogas production as an effective way of keeping their areas clean.'
 'Reduced over-dependence on fuelwood: The use of biogas reduces over-dependence on fuelwood as a source of energy. In areas where biogas is used, people have reduced the use of fuelwood for heating and cooking. This may in turn reduce deforestation and emission of greenhouse gases.  \nMajor source of electricity: HEP is a major source of electricity, which is widely used in Tanzania. As the government centrally manages HEP by 98 percent, all the regions access it through TANESCO, a public utility company, and puts it into various uses, lighting being the main use.  \nImprovement of standards of living: The availability of biogas and hydro-electric power in rural areas has improved people’s standards of living. With power, people have managed to start small projects such as welding, carpentry, and milling. Such projects have become sources of income for the people and have improved their standards of living.'

In Tanzania, the river basins include Rufiji River Basin in which the Stiegler’s Gorge project (Nyerere Hydroelectric Power Plant) for generation of hydroelectric power is located, and Kagera River Basin which is jointly managed by Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi. Other river basin development projects in Africa include the Gezira Irrigation Scheme (Sudan), Aswan High Dam (Egypt) and Galole Irrigation Scheme (Kenya). Others are the Volta River Project (Ghana), Orange River Project (South Africa), Cabora Bassa Basin (Mozambique) and Tana River Development Project in Kenya. Outside Africa, river basin development projects include the Ganges Project (India), Amazon Basin Development Scheme (Brazil), and Tennessee River Basin Project in USA.  \n##### The Tennessee Valley Authority'
 '###### Prospects of the Tennessee Valley Authority  \nThe Tennessee Valley Authority is one of the largest river basin development projects in the world. Despite the innumerable successes achieved so far, TVA still has more room to establish more development projects. The authority aims to exploit sustainably every potential opportunity undertaken in the valley. TVA intends to increase electricity production to meet the ever increasing demand for electricity in the valley. The authority has expressed a desire of achieving more success in its 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). This is a long-term plan that provides direction on how TVA can best meet the electricity demand in the next 20 years. TVA also intends to provide electricity to the people at a price affordable to everyone.  \nThrough this plan, TVA intends to provide regular updates to customers and stakeholders on every development and opportunity available.'
 '###### Environmental stewardship  \nTVA was mandated with the responsibility of managing the natural resources in the Valley for the benefit of the region and the nation. For example, the TVA manages the Tennessee River system and neighbouring public lands so as to reduce flooding, maintain navigation channels, support power production and recreation, improve water quality and supply, and protect shoreline resources. Currently, the authority has a sophisticated system of dams to control flooding along the Tennessee River watershed. This provides an opportunity of controlling the floods by controlling about $ 260 million in flood damage annually. To date, the operation of this system has prevented over US$5.4 billion in flood losses across the Tennessee Valley, including about US$ 4.9 billion in damage averted at Chattanooga the Valley’s most flood-prone city. The system has also prevented about US$ 470millioninfloodlossesinthelower Ohio and Mississippi River drainage basin.'
 '##### The Tennessee Valley Authority  \nThe Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is a federal cooperation agency in the United States of America (USA). It is the largest public power company in the United States. It supplies electricity to millions of people in the USA. Tennessee River is a tributary of the River Ohio River, and the Ohio is a tributary of the River Mississippi River (Figure 3.9). The Tennessee River Basin lies in a seven-state area in the south-eastern part of United States. Its drainage area covers 40,900 square miles (105,930 square kilometers), mostly in the State of Tennessee, but with parts also in Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.  \nFigure 3.9 Tennessee Valley Authority\nSource: bkushistory.pbworks.com tva'
 'The TVA has managed to increase the land for the cultivation of crops. The land, which was earlier affected by soil erosion, has now been controlled using various methods. Trees have been replanted and good cultivation practises, such as construction of terraces, have been applied on the valley slopes. All these measures have stabilised agricultural production, which is a good indicator of agriculture’s contribution to the improvement of income of the people in the Tennessee Valley. The TVA was charged with the following short-term objectives: To control floods, improve navigation, develop HEP, improve the land along the river banks, conserve soils and carry out reforestation projects to check erosion in the region.'

2,I need a short definition question for students about Groundwater sources.,Define groundwater sources.,"['### Sustainable use of water resources  \nWater resources come in many forms, but the three main categories are saltwater, groundwater, and surface water. Sustainable use of water resources includes all activities relating to current and future use of water resources in terms of protection, conservation, and management. There are surface and underground water sources.'
 '#### Underground water:  \nThis is the most plentiful of all freshwater resources. As water percolates into the ground through layers of soil, clay, and rock, some of it adheres to the topmost layers to support plant growth. Most often, groundwater is accessed by humans via wells. To build a well, one must drill down past the water table. In most cases, a pump is placed at the bottom of the well, and water is pumped into homes, businesses, and water treatment plants, where it is then distributed for usage.'
 '### Sources of water  \nThere are several sources of water. These include rainfall, wells, springs, ponds, rivers, lakes, seas and oceans. There are various ways used to manage water resources. These are policies, laws, regulations, and awareness raising campaigns.'
 '#### Infiltration:  \nInfiltration, which is sometimes called percolation, is the process whereby water that has reached the ground penetrates into the soil or rocks (Figure 3.6).  \nSome of the water may seep through and go deep underground and create underground runoff or aquifer in the rocks. Water that percolates the land surface is called underground water. Infiltration is an essential process as it feeds water bodies and soils which are sources of evaporation and evapotranspiration.'
 'This way of waste disposal contaminates shallow wells which may cause water-borne diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea and typhoid. Shallow wells are mostly the source of water for domestic use in many communities, especially those which have no formal water supply from authorised dealers.  \nTransportation and storage of materials which may spill and leak is another source of underground water pollution. For example, chemicals used in manufacturing, processing and construction industries sometimes are not transported and stored by observing any specified handling precautions. This leads to spillage and leakage to the ground and, consequently, seepage into the soil which pollutes underground water through infiltration.'

It is the third largest export earner and contributes significantly to the national economy.\nTourism promotes employment opportunities both within and outside the industry, therefore, it helps to improve people’s living standards.\nTourism promotes the spirit of appreciating other people’s cultures which, in turn, brings about cultural tolerance.\nFurthermore, tourism contributes to the expansion of infrastructure throughout the country.'
 '#### Factors for development of tourism in Switzerland:  \nSeveral factors contribute to the development of Tourism in Switzerland. Switzerland is located in the center of Europe, making it accessible from various countries of Europe, America, and Asia. These countries include France, Germany, Italy, Britain, United States of America and China.  \nSwitzerland has abundant beautiful sceneries, including the Alps Mountains with a large variety of peaks and valleys which attract many tourists. Also, its slopes have abundant snow which attracts tourists interested in skiing and ice-skating. Others are hills, plateaux, plains, large lakes and rivers.  \nOn one hand, the alpine climate and landscapes are favourable for tourists as they consist of cold snowy winters and warm sunny summers. The snow during winter attracts winter sports such as skiing and ice-skating whereas warm and sunny summers attract tourists to view the beautiful sceneries, and engage in swimming and sunbathing.'
 '#### Challenges facing the tourism industry in Switzerland:  \nHeavy snow during winter hinders movement on roads, rails and runways which lowers the influx of tourists.\nIn some cases, the number of tourists fluctuate due to oper competitive countries such as the United States of America.\nTourist attraction centers also experience environmental pollution prough littering and noise from transport means such as trains and cars.'
 '### Tourism in Switzerland  \nSwitzerland is a small land-locked country, located in Central Europe, east of France and north of Italy. It has a total area of 41,290 square kilometres. The country is mountainous with a physical landscape of plateaus of rolled hills, plains, glaciers and large lakes. For example, the Alps Mountains occupy about 60% of the total land. This offers a variety of scenery which comprises snow peaks, lakes, forested areas and glaciers. Switzerland is bordered by Austria, France, Germany, Italy, and Liechtenstein. Tourism in Switzerland takes place in the summer months of July - September when it is easy to view the snow-capped mountain peaks, clear blue skies and cascading waterfalls. Winter months are decorated by abundant snow on mountain slopes for skiing and ice-skating.'
 'The most frequently visited areas during the summer are the Swiss Plateau of Lausanne, Geneva, Bern, Zurich and lake shores. Other places are Ticino Mountain with towns like Lucerne and Lugano.

4,Please can you create a short question that requires small answer on global mineral distribution,Which countries are rich in minerals and which factors affect the exploitation of mineral resources globally according to the information provided in the textbook?,"['#### Distribution of minerals in the world  \nMinerals are unevenly distributed in the world. Some countries are rich in minerals while others are not. The distribution of minerals depends on geological processes which have taken place over a long period of time. The availability of minerals may resemble or differ from country to country or region to region, within the same country. Tanzania is one of the countries in the world that are rich in minerals. It is established that Tanzania has almost all types of minerals which are found in other parts of the world.  \nDiamond, gold, iron, coal, gypsum, copper, uranium, mica, graphite, tin and tanzanite are some of the minerals found in Tanzania. Figure 5.1 shows the distribution of various minerals in Tanzania. Tanzanite is a gemstone only found in Tanzania. Other minerals found in Tanzania are nickel, salt, asbestos, silver, titanium, lead, zinc, platinum, bauxite, soda ash, lime phosphate, sand and natural gas.'
 'Tin is found in South Africa, Nigeria, Rwanda, DRC, China, Indonesia, Peru and Bolivia. Figure 5.2 shows the distribution of some of the major minerals in the world.

5,I need an explaining question for students to discuss the significance of energy resources,"Discuss the importance of power and energy resources in human life, providing examples of their significance in different sectors such as industries, agriculture, and transportation.","['### Importance of power and energy  \nThe following section explains why power and energy are important to human life.  \nRunning machines: Power and energy are used to run machines in industries and provide light at homes, schools, hospitals and other institutions. In the agricultural sector, energy is used to run farm machinery and equipment such as tractors and combine harvesters.  \nRaw materials: Some sources of energy are raw materials of some industries. For example, oil is a raw material for petrochemical and refinery industries in the making of plastics, medicines, clothes, and ropes.  \nTransport enhancement: Energy plays an important role in improving the transport sector because vehicles, locomotives, aircraft, and vessels use petrol or diesel.'
 'Power is found within our bodies, machines, in plants and bodies of animals, insects and birds. Power is also inherently present in natural forces like wind, tides, waves, and water whose movements can be utilized to drive machines, or generate electricity. In our daily lives, power is needed to cook food, to drive machinery in industrial plants, to provide light and heat, and to propel vehicles of different types.  \nEnergy: Energy can be defined as the capacity for, or equivalent of, doing work. Energy is the ability to work so as to produce motion. For example, when water turns a turbine, electricity is produced. Also energy is used to drive machines and provide heat and light.  \nThe society requires energy for transportation, heating and cooling of buildings, powering production processes in industry, and various household needs. Energy can be grouped into various types as explained below.'
 'Renewable energy sources: Renewable energy is any energy source that is naturally replaced. The energy can be derived from sunlight, tides, wind, water, geothermal, or hydroelectric action. Likewise, energy produced from the refining of various forms of biomass is often classified as renewable. The renewable energy sources are usually regarded as environmentally friendly because they release few chemicals that can harm the environment. These are energy resources that are naturally reused. Renewable sources are sustainable if they are carefully managed and maintained. They have minimal negative effects on the environment. Renewable energy sources include sunlight, geothermal heat, wind, tides, water, and various forms of biomass. Some of these energy sources are described in the following sub-sections.'
 'Renewable and non-renewable energy: Renewable energy is energy generated from sources that are essentially inexhaustible. Examples of renewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, geothermal energy, tidal power, and hydroelectric power. Non-renewable energy includes conventional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which are likely to get depleted with use.  \nConventional and non-conventional energy: Conventional energy is an energy source which is fixed in nature like oil, gas, coal, and hydropower generation. It is also termed as non-renewable energy or thermal energy. The conventional energy resources are being used extensively; as a result, their known reserves have been depleted to a great extent. The use of conventional energy has emerging effects on the environment. The non-conventional energy involves energy generated by wind, tides, solar and biomass. These are renewable sources of energy and not exhaustible.'
 '### The concept of Power and Energy  \nPower: Power is the flow of energy at any one time, and can be generated from renewable energy resources through solar conversion (solar, thermal electricity, solar heating); harnessing water (hydropower for electricity, wave and tidal generation through turbines); harnessing the wind (wind pumps for water, wind turbines for electricity); and a variety of other energy sources. The main power sources are petroleum (oil), natural gas, water, coal and nuclear. Other sources include the earth’s interior (hot springs), wind, sun, tides, and waves, wood, peat and cattle or cow dung (biogas).'

6,Please provide a true-false statement concerning the characteristics of commercial farming that my students can answer.,True or False: Large-scale crop cultivation typically involves the use of simple tools such as hand-hoes and machetes for cultivation.,"['#### Characteristics of large-scale crop cultivation:  \nLarge-scale crop cultivation is characterized by cultivation of a large area with the application of high level of technology. The technology involves the use of tractors, combine harvesters, and processing machines. As large-scale farming is highly mechanized, it employs few skilled people because machines carry out agricultural activities that otherwise could have been done manually by humans.  \nIn addition, such commercial farming is capital-intensive to support the production. Also, it is often based on a single crop, a practise known as monoculture. Chemical fertilisers are highly used to maximise yields. Large-scale agriculture is basically a source of raw materials for different manufacturing industries.  \nFigure 2.1 Coffee plant berries  \nsource:https/www.gettyimages.com/photo/coffee-plant'
 '#### Characteristics of commercial livestock-keeping  \nCommercial livestock-keeping takes place on a large area with low population density. More space is needed for the construction of ranches and growing grass for feeding livestock. Generally, commercial livestock-keeping is practiced in more remote areas where other forms of land use are limited. Usually, one type of animal is kept for quality control of products. In addition, commercial livestock-keeping is capital-intensive as it demands money for buying land, paying for labor, fencing, and buying machines and equipment. Furthermore, crossbreeding in commercial livestock-keeping is an important management practice.'
 '### Large-scale crop cultivation:  \nLarge-scale crop cultivation is a farming system that covers a large area of land to produce one type of crop for commercial purposes. This type of large-scale farming is also known as commercial agriculture.  \nIn large-scale crop cultivation, the type of farming practise is mostly monoculture, in which a single crop is produced in large quantities. In developing countries monoculture is associated with tropical and sub-tropical plantation which were established through European colonisation. After independence of individual countries, the plantations were owned by government and others were allocated to individuals as small holders and peasant farmers. These plantations also known as estates are large and found in sparsely populated areas.'
 '#### Characteristics of small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop cultivation is characterised by the following features:  \n(a) The harvest from the farm is used for family consumption.\n(b) It is practised on small pieces of land, often less pan five acres in size.\n(c) Peasants use simple tools such as hand-hoes and machetes for cultivation. In some cases, ox-driven ploughs are used.\n(d) Farmers often grow different types of crops on the same field. This technique is known as intercropping. The crops grown may include grains such as beans, maize and millet.\n(e) It is associated wip the use of organic manure to improve soil fertility.\n(f) Farming activities are mainly done by family members.'
 '### The concept of agriculture  \nAgriculture is a science which deals with crop cultivation and livestock keeping. It is the oldest human activity which has been practiced by many societies in the world. Through agriculture, human beings grow crops for use by households and supply to industries. Factors influencing agriculture include climate, water availability, soil characteristics and terrain. Agriculture is also influenced by availability of financial resources, infrastructure, technology and markets.'

7,"Hi, could you provide a true or false statement about enhancing large-scale farming in Tanzania for my class?",True or False: One of the ways to improve large-scale crop cultivation in Tanzania is by establishing and expanding irrigation schemes through public and private partnerships.,"['There are several ways to improve large-scale crop cultivation in Tanzania. Improvement of the transport network and communication systems will facilitate the transportation of farm inputs to the farm and agricultural products to industrial centers and markets. The government should also render the necessary support to prop up large-scale farming by providing subsidies in addition to creating a conducive investment climate by reducing the heavy and number of taxes on agricultural facilities. Moreover, there is also a need to establish and expand irrigation schemes through public and private partnerships. Furthermore, farmers should be empowered through the establishment of co-operative banks for loan provision and sustainable markets. There is also a need to enforce a mechanism aimed to ensure extension officers work in the field with farmers where they can provide technical assistance on the selection of seeds, use of fertilisers and pesticides, and processing and packaging of crops.'
 'Some of the challenges facing large-scale crop cultivation in Tanzania are high cost of production. Large-scale farming requires a large capital investment to buy machinery and farm inputs, prepare land and pay farm labourers. It also relies on seasonal rainfall. Climatic changes have largely affected the amount of rainfall in many areas of Tanzania. Since the majority of large-scale farmers in Tanzania rely on rain-fed agriculture, whenever there is a shortage of rainfall, agricultural production falls. Agricultural products from large-scale crop cultivation in Tanzania such as tea, sisal and coffee face stiff competition from other countries that produce the same crops. As a result, prices of such products tend to be low. In addition, large-scale crop cultivation in Tanzania has to contend with pests and diseases. Pests such as army worms and quelea quelea tend to destroy crops faster than measures aimed to control them can cope. Inadequate management of pest invasion leads to heavy'

Provide a detailed response outlining these points and any other key disparities you may identify.","['#### Differences between livestock-keeping in Tanzania and Australia:  \nLivestock-keeping in the two countries has the following differences: The majority of livestock in Australia is kept for commercial purposes. Australian sheep, particularly the Merino, are mainly kept for wool production. More than 60 percent of livestock products from Australia are exported to Europe and other continents.'
 'Livestock-keeping in Tanzania, on the contrary, is mainly for meeting domestic demands with some few animals and animal products being exported, but on a lower scale than in Australia. In Tanzania, sheep and goats are kept for meat and skins. Moreover, the application of science and technology in livestock-keeping is much more advanced in Australia than it is in Tanzania. The main rearing system of livestock-keeping in Tanzania is pastoralism and zero-grazing, whereas in Australia it is primarily the ranching system. In addition, Australia has many industries for processing animal products, whereas in Tanzania efforts are underway to establish such industries on a commercial scale.'
 '#### Similarities between livestock -keeping in Tanzania and Australia:  \nLivestock- keeping in Tanzania and Australia has the following similarities:\nBoth countries keep similar types of livestock, for example, cattle and poultry. Also, both countries have set aside areas for ranching. In Australia, ranching is found at Victoria River, Alexandria Station and Anna Creek. These places are found in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and theNorthernTerritory. Examples of ranches in Tanzania are Kongwa, Ruvu, Kagera, Arusha, Morogoro, Kitulo and Lushoto.'
 'In both countries, dairy farming is practised where there is adequate water supply and plenty of pasture. Overall, the development of the livestock-keeping sector is important in both countries. Moreover, the two countries practise livestock at both the subsistence and commercial levels. The animals and their products can be used to meet family needs and sometimes be sold to raise revenue. In Tanzania, sedentary livestock-keeping is practised in densely populated areas and, hence, with a shortage of land such as the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro and the Southern Highlands whereas in Australia it is practised specifically in the South East of the country.'
 'In Tanzania and Australia livestock-keeping is important because it stimulates other sectors of the economy, for example, the development of transport and communication networks and processing industries such as leather and milk. Moreover, livestock-keeping promotes trade through selling animals and animal products within and outside these two countries. It also promotes employment to different people who work in processing industries. Livestock-keeping provides skins, hides, cheese, butter, milk, and meat. These products are sold and enable individual households and the nation to earn money. Furthermore, the sector generates revenue to these countries through tax collection from the industries operating in this livestock sector. It also encourages the use of marginal lands. Livestock-keeping, especially ranching and pastoralism, which need large open areas, make use of land which is otherwise not suitable for other uses.

 '#### Bush fallowing:  \nBush fallowing is not different from shifting cultivation in that in bush fallowing people have permanent settlements. They clear the bush, burn the vegetation, and sow seeds. Yield declines after three to five years. The farm is left to regain its fertility for nearly ten years. Another bush is cleared and cultivated. No movement is involved in bush fallowing. This is possible in areas with dense population. Small-scale crop cultivation is advantageous to farmers. It allows them to grow varieties of food crops. Different crops grown in small farms make it easy to control pests and diseases. Elementary tools such as pangas, hand hoes and axes lead to low cost of running the farms, hence low capital involved. Farmers depend on rainfall only which is unreliable hence, during droughts the farmers suffer from famine.'

 'This is a traditional system of cultivation used in tropical rainforest and miombo wooded savanna. It operates where the population is sparse. People farm and move to another fresh area when the yields are low. The cultivator or farmer burns the forest and sows seeds in the intermixed ash and soil. Little attention is given to the crops until they ripen. If the harvest declines, the land is abandoned, and a fresh area is cleared. The yields decline after three to five years. The cultivator may return to the original land after some years. The constant moves ensure fresh land with high yields, as the land is fertile. There is no serious soil erosion since only a small area is exposed which supports many crops and therefore little bare earth is seen. Any soil washed is trapped by dense plant roots and at the forest edge. The system is less risky of diseases. The methods used in shifting cultivation differ with people’s culture and the varieties of crops they grow. Some use fire to clear'
 '#### Disadvantages of small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop cultivation is associated with loss of soil fertility due to overuse of the same plots of land. Moreover, the practice of burning vegetation during farm preparation tends to destroy soil nutrients, hence lower its fertility. As a result, subsistence or peasant farmers’ yields tend to fall. Such low yields are also contributed by low use of fertilisers and pesticides. Therefore, various ways are needed to reduce the challenges of small-scale crop cultivation.'

Such initiatives should focus on policy, strategy, resource mobilisation and capacity-building. The initiatives aim at translating policies and strategies into action. The following sections present some of the measures aimed to address the identified challenges.  \n- National policies and sub-regional and regional agreements: Tanzania has to demonstrate its commitment in improving the domestic investment environment by taking necessary steps. The actions need to target full liberalisation of the transport sector to attract investors, and strengthening the regulatory and enforcement mechanisms. In addition, improving co-ordination in developing and implementing regional and sub-regional agreements on transport facilitation and air transport liberalisation should be seriously considered.'
 '- Energy efficiency and transport cost: Transport services in Tanzania are associated with high costs due to inadequate and poor infrastructure, poor transport facilities as well as limited competition.\n- Transport safety and security: The government of Tanzania needs to plan for initiatives aimed to improve safety in all modes of transport. This can be done by establishing effective institutional frameworks and strengthening the existing frameworks to manage traffic and ensure safety. Moreover, there is a need to ensure compliance with safety and security regulations and standards established by relevant local, international and regional authorities.\n- Transport information systems: Given the high demand for the use of information in the transport sector and inadequacy of necessary information in the country, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) offers a powerful tool for accessing, processing and disseminating large volumes of information in the shortest time possible.'
 '- Improved transport and communication network: Well-developed transport and communication in Japan and Korea play a big role in the development of industries as the transportation of raw materials tends to be easy and at low costs. Similar conditions should be created to increase productivity in Tanzania’s industries.\n- Investment in research: Both Japan and Korea have heavily invested in research and development particularly on better, efficient, and effective production methods. This has continually improved their production methods and made the costs manageable. Therefore, Tanzania needs to invest in research.\n- Training and development of workers: Japan and Korea have been allocating adequate funds for training to enhance workers’ productivity. This is something that Tanzania should also do to improve the industrial sector.'
 'The improvement of transport and communication contributes to easy movement of tourists from one place to another. Tanzania is investing in improving airline transport to strengthen the tourism industry.  \nIn addition, Tanzania has adequate and comfortable accommodation to cater for tourists with different economic status, hence attracting a large number of tourists.

12,List question for features of commercial livestock farming for form two students,Question: List three characteristics of commercial livestock-keeping as described in the Geography textbook for Form Two students.,"['### Commercial livestock-keeping  \nCommercial livestock-keeping involves rearing of animals for the purpose of selling their products such as meat, milk, wool and hides. Ranching, as part of commercial livestock-keeping, is mostly practised in more remote areas where land is extensive and population density is low. Extensive land provides sufficient grass to support a large number of animals. Commercial livestock-keeping is determined by factors such as capital, level of technology, market, availability of pasture and climatic conditions. In temperate regions, supplementary food such as hay and root crops are used to feed them during winter. Animals are kept for meat (beef cattle), for milk (dairy cattle and camel) and for wool (sheep).'
 '#### Characteristics of commercial livestock-keeping  \nCommercial livestock-keeping takes place on a large area with low population density. More space is needed for the construction of ranches and growing grass for feeding livestock. Generally, commercial livestock-keeping is practiced in more remote areas where other forms of land use are limited. Usually, one type of animal is kept for quality control of products. In addition, commercial livestock-keeping is capital-intensive as it demands money for buying land, paying for labor, fencing, and buying machines and equipment. Furthermore, crossbreeding in commercial livestock-keeping is an important management practice.'
 '#### Advantages of commercial livestock-keeping:  \nCommercial livestock-keeping acts as a source of raw materials for industries such as food processing, shoe, and cloth making. It is one of the sectors which employs people and serves as a source of government revenue. Commercial livestock-keeping provides food products such as meat and milk consumed by households and industries. Moreover, it contributes to the production of goods such as shoes, bags, and animal foods. The benefits of commercial livestock-keeping include the ability to utilize breeds that can enhance reproductive performance. This practice also stimulates the development of transport and communication. Commercial livestock-keeping also facilitates the control of diseases and pests because it limits animal movement. It also uses high technology and scientific methods in management.'
 ""### Livestock-keeping  \nLivestock-keeping is the rearing of animals and poultry for food and commercial purposes. The word 'livestock' applies primarily to cattle or dairy cows, goats, pigs, camels, horses, mules, poultry, and sheep. The word 'livestock' applies primarily to cattle or dairy cows, goats, pigs, camels, horses, mules, poultry and sheep. Poultry includes ducks, chicken, turkey, and geese. The population growth and ever increasing demand for food supply lead to the growth of livestock-keeping. Livestock-keeping contributes to the economic development of a country since it is a source of food as well as raw materials for industries. It is also a source of income as well as employment opportunities. Besides, it is a source of foreign currency.""
 '### Large-scale crop cultivation:  \nLarge-scale crop cultivation is a farming system that covers a large area of land to produce one type of crop for commercial purposes. This type of large-scale farming is also known as commercial agriculture.  \nIn large-scale crop cultivation, the type of farming practise is mostly monoculture, in which a single crop is produced in large quantities. In developing countries monoculture is associated with tropical and sub-tropical plantation which were established through European colonisation. After independence of individual countries, the plantations were owned by government and others were allocated to individuals as small holders and peasant farmers. These plantations also known as estates are large and found in sparsely populated areas.'

13,"hi, can you help with a explaining question where students describe about Tropical monsoon forests for their homework",Describe the characteristics of a tropical monsoon forest based on the provided context.,"['#### Characteristics of a tropical monsoon forest  \nA monsoon forest has characteristics that distinguish it from other types of forests. Monsoon forests contain thick undergrowth of shrubs and small trees. This poses a challenge to people and animals when it comes to passing through these forests. However, the forest is more open compared to equatorial rainforests. The main trees in these forests are teak, acacia, casuarina, and bamboo. Trees in this forest are moderately tall compared to trees of other types of forests. They grow up to 30 meters high. Trees are not as close as in tropical evergreen forests. Due to this reason, the undergrowth tends to be a bit thick.'
 '#### Tropical monsoon forests:  \nTropical monsoon forests consist of deciduous trees that shed their leaves during the dry season. Figure 4.4 shows a section of a monsoon forest. These forests are located in the monsoon climate beyond the equatorial region between 10º and 25º North and South of the Equator. These forests are found in areas with seasonal rainfall, along coastal regions of Southwest India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, South Western Africa, and North-East and South-East Brazil.  \n| Figure 4.3 Mangrove forest                     | Figure 4.4 Tropical monsoon forest           |\n| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| Source: https://www.animalwised.com/endangered | Source: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tropical |'

The types of natural forests include equatorial rainforest, tropical monsoon, deciduous, coniferous and mangrove. The natural forests are found in many countries. Figure 4.1 shows the distribution of various world natural forests.'
 '#### Characteristics of an equatorial rainforest  \nAn equatorial rainforest has some characteristics that distinguish it from other types of forests. In an equatorial rainforest, the vegetation grows in layers. The upper layer forms a continuous canopy, which provides shade for lower layers. Trees grow to over 80 metres high. The second or middle layer grows up to about 30 metres high. The lower canopy grows to a range of 5 to 15 metres high. It consists of shrubs, palms and ferns with little undergrowth.  \nThe trees in this tropical rainforest are of different species, which include mahogany, rosewood, greenheart, ironwood and ebony. Most trees have large buttress roots. In addition, tropical rainforests contain climber trees.  \nNearly all the trees are broad-leaved and evergreen due to the availability of rainfall throughout the year. However, due to constant climatic conditions, plants produce flowers, fruits and shade their leaves at the same time.'
 '#### Equatorial rainforest:  \nThis type of forest is found in the equatorial region between 5˚N and 5˚S of the Equator.

 'In Tanzania and Australia livestock-keeping is important because it stimulates other sectors of the economy, for example, the development of transport and communication networks and processing industries such as leather and milk. Moreover, livestock-keeping promotes trade through selling animals and animal products within and outside these two countries. It also promotes employment to different people who work in processing industries. Livestock-keeping provides skins, hides, cheese, butter, milk, and meat. These products are sold and enable individual households and the nation to earn money. Furthermore, the sector generates revenue to these countries through tax collection from the industries operating in this livestock sector. It also encourages the use of marginal lands. Livestock-keeping, especially ranching and pastoralism, which need large open areas, make use of land which is otherwise not suitable for other uses. Farmers also apply cattle manure to add nutrients to the soil'
 '#### Challenges facing livestock-keeping in Tanzania  \nPrevalence of pests and diseases affects animals’ health and, eventually, causes low or poor production. Also, over-grazing causes shortage of water, pasture and soil erosion. There is also a problem of poor transportation of livestock and livestock products from one place to another. In addition, low level of technology to improve the animal breeds as well as preserve animal products has been another limitation in the development of livestock-keeping in the country. These challenges lead to low quality and productivity. The low livestock production in turn, lowers the quality of life of livestock-keepers and affects development generally. Lack of reliable markets is a serious threat to the sustainability of the livestock-keeping sector.'

17,I need explain question about all the things students should know about using solar and wind power in USA for their homework.,Explain how the importance of solar and wind energy in the USA is reflected in the efforts made by the American Government to promote their use.,"['#### Importance of solar and wind energy in USA:  \nUSA finds it more economical to use solar and wind energy than other sources of energy as they have minimal environmental effects. Solar and wind energy in USA is important in so many ways.  \nEnvironmentally-friendly: The production of solar and wind energy involves activities which produce less waste in the environment compared to other sources of energy. These energies, therefore, are considered to be environmentally-friendly. For example, their production reduces the emission of carbon-dioxide and other pollutants.  \nCreation of employment opportunities: Installation and management of solar panels and wind mills require many employees. This industry generates jobs for thousands of people.'
 '### Solar and wind energy harnessing in USA  \nUSA is one of the leading countries in the world harnessing energy from the Sun. Before 2008, much of the electricity was generated from other sources such as fossil fuel and HEP. By 2018, solar power accounted for 1.44 percent of the total USA electricity, generating about 58.9 terawatt-hours (TWH).  \nUSA needs energy that is secure, reliable, protective of the environment, and able to address climate change, create jobs and improve public health. USA reduced the use of fossil fuel as a source of energy because it is expensive and not renewable. The American Government reduces the cost of solar power and increases the cost of fossil fuel to encourage use of the former. USA, as a highly developed country in terms of technology and economy, has a very high demand for power and energy for industrial and domestic use.'
 'Solar energy is harnessed on a large- scale in the states of California, Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina, New Jersey and Massachusetts. These areas are more conducive for harnessing solar power because of the sunny climate, clear skies and plenty of land. The electricity generated is integrated into the US National Grid.  \nWind energy is also used more in USA compared to solar energy. The country has a big potential of onshore and offshore winds. Wind energy is used in running large farms and industries. The leading wind energy producing centers are California, Oklahoma, Illinois, and Kansas. Wind power generation and use in USA is expanding quickly. It experiences an annual growth of 25.6 percent. For example, in 2017, wind power generated 6.3 percent of electricity in the USA.'
 '#### Challenges facing solar and wind energy in USA:  \nAlthough USA has a large and strong economy, it faces challenges related to the wind and solar energy sector. The following are some of the challenges.  \nSolar panel efficiency: Most solar power panels are 10 – 20 percent efficient, as they are stationary and cannot move to capture the sun’s rays. That being the case, a large percentage of the energy from the sun remains largely untapped, although the cost of solar power has decreased.  \nReliability: Solar and wind energy are not reliable sources of energy because sunrays and wind happen naturally and human beings can hardly control their occurrence. The extent of solar and wind energy production will largely depend on the intensity of wind and sunrays and the technology available to tap them.'
 '#### Addressing challenges facing solar and wind energy in USA:  \nThe challenges facing solar and wind energy production may hinder the expected harnessing of this potential energy if deliberate efforts are not made to address them.  \nInstallation of wind turbines and solar panels: Solar and wind energy depends very much on the number and quality of wind turbines and solar panels. The higher the quality of gadgets available, the more the amount of energy produced. It is, therefore, advisable to install enough wind turbines and solar panels over a wide area to increase the amount of energy harnessed.  \nResearch: Research on solar and wind energy is likely to find some solutions to many challenges facing the production of energy from wind and the sun. Research may involve studying the behaviour of wind and new technologies for tapping solar energy day and night.'

18,Please send a short answer question on Fundamentals of Power and Energy.,What are the main power sources discussed in the context of power and energy in geography?,"['### The concept of Power and Energy  \nPower: Power is the flow of energy at any one time, and can be generated from renewable energy resources through solar conversion (solar, thermal electricity, solar heating); harnessing water (hydropower for electricity, wave and tidal generation through turbines); harnessing the wind (wind pumps for water, wind turbines for electricity); and a variety of other energy sources. The main power sources are petroleum (oil), natural gas, water, coal and nuclear. Other sources include the earth’s interior (hot springs), wind, sun, tides, and waves, wood, peat and cattle or cow dung (biogas).'
 '### Importance of power and energy  \nThe following section explains why power and energy are important to human life.  \nRunning machines: Power and energy are used to run machines in industries and provide light at homes, schools, hospitals and other institutions. In the agricultural sector, energy is used to run farm machinery and equipment such as tractors and combine harvesters.  \nRaw materials: Some sources of energy are raw materials of some industries. For example, oil is a raw material for petrochemical and refinery industries in the making of plastics, medicines, clothes, and ropes.  \nTransport enhancement: Energy plays an important role in improving the transport sector because vehicles, locomotives, aircraft, and vessels use petrol or diesel.'
 'Power is found within our bodies, machines, in plants and bodies of animals, insects and birds. Power is also inherently present in natural forces like wind, tides, waves, and water whose movements can be utilized to drive machines, or generate electricity. In our daily lives, power is needed to cook food, to drive machinery in industrial plants, to provide light and heat, and to propel vehicles of different types.  \nEnergy: Energy can be defined as the capacity for, or equivalent of, doing work. Energy is the ability to work so as to produce motion. For example, when water turns a turbine, electricity is produced. Also energy is used to drive machines and provide heat and light.  \nThe society requires energy for transportation, heating and cooling of buildings, powering production processes in industry, and various household needs. Energy can be grouped into various types as explained below.'
 '### Addressing the challenges of energy and power production:  \nDifferent measures can be taken to address power challenges and energy production challenges, they include the following:  \n- Desilting of dams: Regular removal of silt (desilting) from the dams is recommended to maintain the necessary depth for power generation. If desilting is ignored, the decreased depth of dams may affect the production of HEP since the storage capacity of the dam is severely reduced.\n- Alternative energy sources: Alternative sources of energy such as solar energy should be used to reduce the effect of pollution caused by the use of fossil fuels and fuelwood.\n- Environmental conservation projects: The establishment of power and energy production projects should go hand in hand with environmental conservation projects such as afforestation, reforestation, and proper waste management.'
 'Renewable and non-renewable energy: Renewable energy is energy generated from sources that are essentially inexhaustible. Examples of renewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, geothermal energy, tidal power, and hydroelectric power. Non-renewable energy includes conventional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which are likely to get depleted with use.  \nConventional and non-conventional energy: Conventional energy is an energy source which is fixed in nature like oil, gas, coal, and hydropower generation. It is also termed as non-renewable energy or thermal energy. The conventional energy resources are being used extensively; as a result, their known reserves have been depleted to a great extent. The use of conventional energy has emerging effects on the environment. The non-conventional energy involves energy generated by wind, tides, solar and biomass. These are renewable sources of energy and not exhaustible.'

 '### Clove:  \nClove is an evergreen tree of humid tropical climate (Figure 2.8). Its flower buds are spices used in food, drinks and medicine. The clove was introduced in Zanzibar in the United Republic of Tanzania in the first half of the 19th century from Indonesia. Clove growing in Zanzibar started with plantations but it has progressively been fragmented into smaller holdings of about 3 acres. The prominent clove growing countries in the world are Indonesia, India and Madagascar. Indonesia is the biggest grower, importer and consumer of cloves.'
 '#### Conditions for growing cloves:  \nCloves require a humid tropical climate with annual average temperatures of between 20°C and 30°C. They prefer well distributed rainfall, which is ideal for flowering. In this regard, the annual rainfall should range from 1,500 mm – 2,500 mm. In addition, cloves require deep loamy soils with high humus content and well-drained black loam soils of semi-forest regions. Cloves need good drainage and prefer partial shade and a cooler climate.'
 '#### Harvesting, processing and transportation of cloves:  \nClove trees can grow up to 15 meters high. Therefore, harvesting involves picking of flower buds which is done by climbing or scaling.\nHarvesting is done by hand by skilled climbers. In Zanzibar, the harvesting occurs from September to November.\nSorting is necessary to separate leaves from the buds. The buds and flowers are left to dry in the sun for 3 - 7 days.\nTo ensure quality, the dirty and unwanted particles are removed from the dried cloves. The Zanzibar State Trading Corporation (ZSTC) is an organ responsible for buying and exporting cloves from the Isles in Tanzania to major importers such as Taiwan, India, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.'
 '#### Farm preparation, planting and care of cloves:  \nClove seeds are sown at 2 cm to 3 cm spacing wip a depp of about 2 cm.\nThe germinated seedlings are transplanted in bags. The seed-beds have to be protected from direct sunlight.\nThe young plants are left for almost 2 years. Then the seedlings are transplanted in the field at the spacing of 6 to 7 meters apart.'

20,I need a define question for soil absorption,Define the term soil absorption.,"['(b) Reclamation of land affected by soil erosion differs from land covered by water. Soil affected by erosion calls for planting of trees. Trees will act as binding agents for keeping the soil particles together and absorbing excess water which would otherwise flow rapidly over the land. Moreover, using better methods of agriculture such as contour ploughing, terracing, and strip farming especially in steep slopes helps to prevent erosion.  \n(c) Land may also be reclaimed by restoring its fertility. In this case, land which has lost fertility may require planting cover crops and addition of organic manure and fertilisers to improve its fertility. The fertility will attract vegetation growth. Vegetation will not only bind the soil but also protect it from excessive loss of water through transpiration.  \n(d) Land affected by excessive animal keeping can be restored by reducing the number of animals in the area. This simple reclamation method allows the land to be proportionally used.'
 '#### Soil:  \nThe type of soil also determines the amount of water that can be retained in the soil and the amount of water that can be drawn from the soil through transpiration or evaporation. Fertile soil tends to support the growth of vegetation which increases the rate of evapotranspiration. Soil, which supports vegetation, allows much evapotranspiration to take place.'
 '#### Infiltration:  \nInfiltration, which is sometimes called percolation, is the process whereby water that has reached the ground penetrates into the soil or rocks (Figure 3.6).  \nSome of the water may seep through and go deep underground and create underground runoff or aquifer in the rocks. Water that percolates the land surface is called underground water. Infiltration is an essential process as it feeds water bodies and soils which are sources of evaporation and evapotranspiration.'
 'During photosynthesis, oxygen is released by plants into the environment through the stomata, and this is used by animals. At the same time animals release carbon dioxide that is absorbed by the plants. By doing so, a balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide in the environment is maintained. Forests provide suitable habitats for wildlife and, therefore, contribute to the balance of ecosystem. Various animals live in the forest which gives them shelter and food as they eat leaves, roots and fruits. Moreover, forests help to control soil erosion as they protect the soil from being eroded by blowing wind and running water. Trees in the forest bind together the soil particles using roots, and reduce the impact of raindrops with the same roots. Plant leaves reduce the impact of rain drops on the soil and reduce excessive evaporation of soil water.'

The petroleum and natural gas are used for various purposes including heating homes, fueling cars, powering factories, and serving as raw materials for plastics, chemicals, medicines, fertilizers, and synthetic fibers.'
 '#### Mining industry  \nMining is the branch of manufacturing industries and trade based on the extraction of ores, fossil fuels, minerals, stone, clay, gravel, and similar commodities. This does not include the refinement of these commodities. The mining industry contains five categories, which are defined by the resources they produce: oil and gas extraction, coal mining, metal ore mining, non-metallic mineral mining and quarrying, and support activities for mining.'
 '#### Types of manufacturing industries in East Africa:  \nThere are different types of manufacturing industries in East Africa. They can be grouped as follows:\ni. Food and beverage industries\nii. Chemical industries\niii. Textile industries\niv. Mineral extraction industries\nv. Iron and steel industries: They make iron and steel bars, wires, and other iron and steel products.\nvi. Lumbering industries: These industries deal with the production of timber, wood pulp and other products from wood. Paper industries rely on softwood which grows fast.\nvii. Fuel and power industries: These industries deal with the extraction of oil, petroleum, coal, natural gas, and refining and generation of power from various sources such as steam and coal.'
 '#### Mining  \nMining is a process of extracting valuable geological substances from the crust of the earth. The extracted materials may be minerals, fossil fuels, and other geological materials. However, not all geological substances are categorized as minerals. In science, a mineral has specific characteristics such as being solid, inorganic, naturally occurring, has definite chemical composition and ordered internal structure. Although oil, coal and natural gas do not possess most of these characteristics, they may be categorized as minerals. From a non-scientific view, a mineral refers to a non-living naturally occurring resource from the earth. As such, oil, coal, and natural gas also qualify to be called mineral resources. Thus, petroleum and natural gas which are discussed as case studies in this chapter are treated as minerals. Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water.'
 'Surface mining is done by removing (stripping) surface vegetation, dirt, and, if necessary, layers of bedrock in order to reach buried ore deposits. Techniques of surface mining include: open-pit mining or open cast mining, which is the recovery of materials from an open pit in the ground; and quarrying, identical to open-pit mining except that it refers to sand, stone and clay. Open cast mining is the cheapest method of extracting minerals. This method is used to extract minerals which usually occur close to the earth’s surface. This method involves removing the top layers of the earth and other overlying materials above the mineral ores. Figure 5.3 shows an open cast mine. The extraction involves the use of earth moving machines and bulldozers, and electric shovels. Sometimes explosion is used to blow overlying materials in order to reach the ore beneath. This method is cheaper because the output is bigger than the costs of running. The open cast method is used to extract quarrying'

The amount of water released from the spring depends on the nature of the rocks and the position of the water table. A large amount of water from a spring can form a river while small amounts may form small channels.'
 '#### Surface water:  \nSurface water is water that exists in streams and lakes. This water is primarily used for potable water supply, recreation, irrigation, industry, livestock, transportation, and hydroelectric energy. Over 63 percent of the public water supply is withdrawn from surface water. Irrigation gets 58 percent of its water supply from surface water. Industry gets almost 98 percent of its water from surface water systems. Small amounts may come from small channels.  \nSome springs release hot water, hence the name ""hot springs"". Other springs may eject hot water and steam hence the tag ""geysers"".'
 '#### Underground water  \nUnderground water is water beneath the earth’s surface particularly in the faults or joints of rocks and soil pores. Usually, underground water is found in the rock spaces (aquifers) which collect after infiltration through rock faults or joints. The rocks that allow water to seep through are called permeable rocks. The rocks with holes or pores through which water can pass are called porous rocks whereas rocks with joints or faults through which water infiltrates are called pervious rocks. The process of underground water formation primarily depends on the amount of rainfall in a particular area and the nature of rocks found there. When rain falls, water infiltrates through the soil and fills the joints and forms underground water. The water becomes naturally stored and ultimately gets out through springs, bore holes, and wells.'
 '### Precipitation  \nPrecipitation is the falling of water from the clouds in form of rain, snow, sleet or hail. Figure 3.5 shows different forms of precipitation. It is the last stage that demonstrates the return of water to the earth’s surface after changing into a gaseous form. Precipitation may be heavy or light thereby creating heavy rain, snow or hail. Whereas rain is directly in liquid form, snow and hail are water in solid form as a result of freezing. Water reaches the ground in form of snow or hail after the temperature in the atmosphere fails to melt it completely before reaching the ground. Upon reaching the ground, which has higher temperature than the atmosphere, the snow and hail melt into liquid as surface run-off. Also some water infiltrates into the earth’s surface through soil and cracks.  \nFigure 3.5 Different forms of precipitation\nSource: pinterest.com-forms of precipitation'
 '(vi) Pollution from industrial activities as is the case with oil drilling regions of the Niger Delta has resulted in damage to the environment in nearby shores.\n(vii) When fresh water resources become saline, they can no longer be used for irrigation or drinking. Saline water is toxic to plants, and high sodium levels cause dry soils to become hard and compact and reduce their ability to absorb water. Ground water extraction and irrigation can increase salt concentrations in water. Irrigation can also cause salinization by raising the water table and lifting saline ground water near the surface into the root zone. This occurs when irrigation efficiency is poor, so a large fraction of irrigation water infiltrates into the soil, and groundwater flow is slow. A similar problem occurs in some regions when trees are cut down.'

This type of soil contains a lot of decayed vegetable matter with little amounts of sand and clay. Rainfall plays an important role as far as fibre production is concerned. On the whole, sisal does not need too much rainfall and cannot tolerate frosty conditions.'
 'Bulbils are initially grown in nurseries before being transplanted in double rows after a year. In the nursery, the bulbils should be planted in beds at 10 cm x 10 cm apart. It is recommended to use sisal waste for their growth. Thereafter, they are shifted to a second bed where they are planted at 30 cm x 30 cm apart. After 12 to 18 months, the young sisal plants are ready to be planted in the field. Unlike many other crops, sisal does not need much care. However, when it is planted on a previously used old land, it is important to use fertiliser. During the first two years it is important to control weeds by hand, machines or chemicals. Although the sisal plant is resistant to pests and diseases, it is important to control pests and diseases such as sisal weevil and bole rot. Growing sisal does not require irrigation as the sisal plant is drought-resistant and cultivated as a rain-fed crop.'
 '### Sisal  \nSisal is a tropical plant whose leaves produce strong threads (fibres) which are used for various purposes such as rope and carpet making. Sisal was originally grown in southern Mexico. Subsequently, it has been widely cultivated in many other countries. In fact, it has widely been introduced in the tropics and subtropics. In Tanzania, sisal was introduced in 1893 by Dr Richard Hindorf and the first 62 sisal plants were planted near Pangani in Tanga Region. Until the 1960s, Tanzania was the leading producer of sisal, but since then Brazil has become the major world producer of sisal, followed by Tanzania, Kenya, Madagascar and China. In Tanzania, sisal is grown in Tanga, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Morogoro, Lindi and Mtwara regions.  \nFigure 2.7 Sisal farm in Tanga  \nSource: https://www.ippmedia.com/en/news/strategising-restore-sisal-cash-crop-day'
 '#### Harvesting, processing and transportation of sisal:  \nHarvesting of sisal begins when the colour of thorns at the tips changes from dark brown to light-brown. The processing of leaves should take place 48 hours after being harvested. Through processing, sisal fibres are obtained whereby the leaves are crushed between rollers and then mechanically scraped. Then the fibres are washed and dried. Drying of fibres is done in the sun or by using drying machines. This is followed by brushing of the dried fibres for straightening as well as polishing. Thereafter, the fibres are graded depending on their length and colour. It is important to ensure cleanliness of the bale.

This movement increases the rate of evapotranspiration as it clears any humidity around the plants, hence increasing the rate of transpiration.'
 'Power is found within our bodies, machines, in plants and bodies of animals, insects and birds. Power is also inherently present in natural forces like wind, tides, waves, and water whose movements can be utilized to drive machines, or generate electricity. In our daily lives, power is needed to cook food, to drive machinery in industrial plants, to provide light and heat, and to propel vehicles of different types.  \nEnergy: Energy can be defined as the capacity for, or equivalent of, doing work. Energy is the ability to work so as to produce motion. For example, when water turns a turbine, electricity is produced. Also energy is used to drive machines and provide heat and light.  \nThe society requires energy for transportation, heating and cooling of buildings, powering production processes in industry, and various household needs. Energy can be grouped into various types as explained below.'
 '#### Addressing challenges facing solar and wind energy in USA:  \nThe challenges facing solar and wind energy production may hinder the expected harnessing of this potential energy if deliberate efforts are not made to address them.  \nInstallation of wind turbines and solar panels: Solar and wind energy depends very much on the number and quality of wind turbines and solar panels. The higher the quality of gadgets available, the more the amount of energy produced. It is, therefore, advisable to install enough wind turbines and solar panels over a wide area to increase the amount of energy harnessed.  \nResearch: Research on solar and wind energy is likely to find some solutions to many challenges facing the production of energy from wind and the sun. Research may involve studying the behaviour of wind and new technologies for tapping solar energy day and night.'
 '### Evapotranspiration  \nEvapotranspiration refers to the process whereby water is transferred from the land to the air through plant roots and leaves. Water from the land is carried by roots to the leaves, a process known as transpiration, and then from the leaves it changes into vapour and moves into the atmosphere through the process of evaporation. The combination of these two processes form what is termed as evapotranspiration (Evaporation + transpiration = evapotranspiration). Evapotranspiration is determined by factors such as temperature, humidity, wind, soil, and type of plants. These factors are hereby explained.'
 '#### Challenges facing solar and wind energy in USA:  \nAlthough USA has a large and strong economy, it faces challenges related to the wind and solar energy sector. The following are some of the challenges.  \nSolar panel efficiency: Most solar power panels are 10 – 20 percent efficient, as they are stationary and cannot move to capture the sun’s rays. That being the case, a large percentage of the energy from the sun remains largely untapped, although the cost of solar power has decreased.  \nReliability: Solar and wind energy are not reliable sources of energy because sunrays and wind happen naturally and human beings can hardly control their occurrence. The extent of solar and wind energy production will largely depend on the intensity of wind and sunrays and the technology available to tap them.'

26,Can you help with right or wrong statement for my students on how the distance to water sources influences Tanzanian girls?,How does the distance to water sources affect the participation of Tanzanian girls in productive economic activities and school enrolment?,"['### Effects of distance to water sources on the girl-child in Tanzania  \nWater fetching in most Tanzanian societies is a cultural and gender-related activity in terms of who is responsible for carrying it from the sources. The responsibility of fetching water and the overall water management in households is influenced by gender and cultural norms. The burden of fetching water is borne by both women and children, particularly girls. They travel over long distances to fetch water for domestic purposes.  \nThese distances coupled with other factors such as difficult terrain, poor water flow, and queues at the water sources take a lot of time from girls. Fetching water appears to have a direct effect on the physical health of the girls and their ability to participate in domestic responsibilities.'
 '## Chapter Three (Water management for economic development)  \n### Introduction  \nIn this chapter, you will learn about the uses and economic importance of water; the relationship between family size, water supply, and the quality of life; the relationship between vegetation and water supply; and the effects of distance to water sources from households to a girl child in Tanzania. You will also learn about river basin development, requirements for establishing a river basin project, as well as benefits and challenges facing river basin projects. Finally, you will learn about land reclamation, underground water, aquatic resources, pollution, and water conservation.'
 'The extent of the problem of walking over long distances to water sources is more pronounced in low and middle income societies than in high income ones. Since economic, political and socialinequalitiesarereflectedinaccess to drinking water, the marginalised groups may suffer differently from the negative economic and health effects of carrying water over long distances. Furthermore, this situation leads to material deprivation for women, lack of voice and capacity to cope with any form of crisis. This, in turn, widens the poverty gap and gender inequalities in Tanzania.'
 'In addition, carrying water over long distances limits women’s participation in productive economic activities, hence low school enrolment for girls. Access to water and sanitation is, therefore, related to the time that girls need to attend school, and can be among the reasons that keep them out of school. Therefore, access to fresh water and sanitation does not only improve the health of a family, but also provides an opportunity for girls to attend school and spend their time more productively on academics than on fetching water.'
 '3. Climate related problems like drought have been affecting water availability; sometimes the volume of water in the river decreases. Climatic changes are experienced in most parts of Tanzania including Rufiji Basin, with prolonged drought and unreliable rainfall leading to insufficient water supply. This situation affects food production in the basin, sugar plantations, HEP and wildlife.\n4.

HEP is one of the main sources of power in Tanzania. In Tanzania, electricity generation depends heavily on HEP. However, this type of energy cannot be relied upon in times of drought. The government through the Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO), a parastatal organization, manages the HEP across the country. The company produces hydro-electricity from natural waterfalls or man-made dams and supplies it to the users in the country.'

In this chapter, you will learn about the major sources of power, the methods of acquiring and extracting power and energy, and the uses of power and energy resources. You will also learn about the problems facing power and energy production, specifically solar and wind power production in the USA, hydroelectric and biogas production in Tanzania. Finally, you will learn about problems related to power and energy extraction in the USA and Tanzania.'
 'Basin development projects involve the establishment of hydroelectric power plants following the construction of dams. The water from the dams is used to generate electricity for domestic and industrial purposes. In Tanzania, Mtera, Kidatu and Kihansi dams in Rufiji Basin are hydroelectric power stations. In addition to hydroelectric power, the constructed dams create opportunities for fishing; for example, Mtera Dam is oneofthedamswherefishingactivities take place. Moreover, well-managed basins which have gorges, waterfalls, man made reservoirs and land scenery attract tourism. Tourism is one of the potential sources of income and contributes significantly to the national economy.'
 'HEP is primarily advantageous because it does not discharge pollutants into the environment. In addition, if people turn to using hydroelectric power, deforestation caused by use of fuelwood may be reduced. The problems faced with hydropower have to do with the aging of the dams. It is costly to maintain them for their functionality and safety. Globally, China has the biggest hydroelectric generation capacity in the world, followed by Brazil, Canada, and Russia. Currently, hydropower constitutes over 45% of the total power generated in Tanzania.  \n| Figure 8.4 | Hydro-electric power/energy             |\n| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| Figure 8.4 | A model of a hydro-electric power plant |'
 '### Addressing challenges to power and energy harnessing in Tanzania:  \nDespite the challenges to harnessing power and energy, the following are some of the solutions to the challenges facing power and energy harnessing in Tanzania.  \nAlternative sources of power: Alternative sources of power to support the existing sources should be explored to meet the increasing power demand in Tanzania.

Shallow wells are mostly the source of water for domestic use in many communities, especially those which have no formal water supply from authorised dealers.  \nTransportation and storage of materials which may spill and leak is another source of underground water pollution. For example, chemicals used in manufacturing, processing and construction industries sometimes are not transported and stored by observing any specified handling precautions. This leads to spillage and leakage to the ground and, consequently, seepage into the soil which pollutes underground water through infiltration.'
 'Many people in the world and particularly in the developing countries have inadequate water supply to meet their daily needs. Indeed, shortage of water has a serious health implication as it can lead to illness and even death among the poor in many developing countries. Water-borne diseases such as cholera, bilharzia, typhoid and diarrhoea are common in areas with scarcity of water supply. About three-quarters of households in sub-Saharan Africa get water from sources located away from their homes, with women and girls bearing the main task of collecting water for their respective households.'
 '### Water pollution  \nWater pollution occurs when harmful substances of different quality, quantity and form are mixed in underground water. The water may be polluted through discharging waste in it or mixing it with chemicals usually from factories and industries. Besides, water pollution is also caused by domestic practices especially channelling toilet waste into water streams. All the materials which pollute water are called pollutants. Water pollution is at times caused by the construction of latrines directly in the ground. This way of pollution affects mostly underground water. The latrines tend to seep wastes into the underground water. Many homes and industries with no access to sewerage systems rely on shallow underground disposal of waste.'
 'Furthermore, underground water is at times polluted by human activities in their effort to use the land to earn a livelihood. Experience shows that modern farming is characterised by the use of fertilisers, herbicides, insecticides and pesticides. The misuse of these chemicals in farming harms the soil and once rain falls the chemicals contaminate the underground water through infiltration.  \nUnderground water can also be polluted naturally through volcanic eruption. This occurs in areas characterised by eruption of poisonous volcanic materials from the interior of the Earth. The erupted materials finally seep into the soil and mix with underground water. Generally, pollution of underground water is harmful to the lives of people and other living organisms, which directly or indirectly use the water.'
 '#### Infiltration:  \nInfiltration, which is sometimes called percolation, is the process whereby water that has reached the ground penetrates into the soil or rocks (Figure 3.6).  \nSome of the water may seep through and go deep underground and create underground runoff or aquifer in the rocks. Water that percolates the land surface is called underground water. Infiltration is an essential process as it feeds water bodies and soils which are sources of evaporation and evapotranspiration.'

29,Create a T-F statement for students to assess their understanding of Extensive crop cultivation.,"True or False:
Extensive crop cultivation involves the cultivation of cash crops on estates.","['#### Types of large-scale crop cultivation:  \nLarge-scale crop cultivation can be divided into two types: plantation agriculture and extensive food cultivation. Plantation agriculture involves cultivation of cash crops on estates. The cultivation is highly mechanised. Major crops grown on plantations include coffee, cotton, tea, rubber, oil palms, cocoa, sisal, and sugar cane. Plantation agriculture is dominant in some regions of Africa, Asia, North and South America where there are favourable climatic conditions. Extensive food cultivation deals with large-scale food crop production. Machines are highly used in ploughing, sowing, harvesting, processing, packaging, and transportation of farm produce. Crops grown under extensive agriculture are cereals which include beans, maize, and wheat. A description of some of the crops under large-scale crop production is provided in the following sub-sections.'
 '#### Characteristics of small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop cultivation is characterised by the following features:  \n(a) The harvest from the farm is used for family consumption.\n(b) It is practised on small pieces of land, often less pan five acres in size.\n(c) Peasants use simple tools such as hand-hoes and machetes for cultivation. In some cases, ox-driven ploughs are used.\n(d) Farmers often grow different types of crops on the same field. This technique is known as intercropping. The crops grown may include grains such as beans, maize and millet.\n(e) It is associated wip the use of organic manure to improve soil fertility.\n(f) Farming activities are mainly done by family members.'
 '### Large-scale crop cultivation:  \nLarge-scale crop cultivation is a farming system that covers a large area of land to produce one type of crop for commercial purposes. This type of large-scale farming is also known as commercial agriculture.  \nIn large-scale crop cultivation, the type of farming practise is mostly monoculture, in which a single crop is produced in large quantities. In developing countries monoculture is associated with tropical and sub-tropical plantation which were established through European colonisation. After independence of individual countries, the plantations were owned by government and others were allocated to individuals as small holders and peasant farmers. These plantations also known as estates are large and found in sparsely populated areas.'
 '#### Small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop cultivation is the growing of crops on a small piece of land. It is also called subsistence farming. It aims to produce enough food for the wellbeing of families. In some instances, when the production is high, the surplus is sold. Individuals engaging in small-scale crop cultivation are known as peasants. They are also called subsistence farmers as they grow food crops to feed themselves and their families with little or no surplus for sale.  \nAs noted earlier, the agricultural system at subsistence level falls under this category. A farmer owns a small piece of land for food crops cultivation. The produce is enough only for the family. It is hand to mouth existence which may lead to famine if the harvest is bad. In years with good harvest the farmer may have surplus to sell to the local markets. The farms are small, about one to five hectares owned by the family. Application of machines is difficult as farms are small.'
 'The resulting population growth affects land use patterns. This may cause shortage of food and poor living standards. The solution to this problem is to improve small-scale crop cultivation. The government and other organisations should help farmers by providing them with education and capital to make subsistence agriculture more intensive and more productive. Moreover, the government, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and co-operative societies should help the farmers to select better seeds, use proper insecticides, pesticides, and apply fertilisers properly. In addition, they should help in providing transport to make sure the products reach proper storage places and markets. Furthermore, the government should emphasise and support the opening of joint agriculture ventures, finding of markets for surplus products and establishing good storage facilities. Additionally, deliberate efforts should be made to provide education on good farming practises, for example, the use of simple'

It is grown on both small-scale on farm lots and large-scale on plantations. In Tanzania palm oil is grown in Kigoma and Mbeya regions. Other palm oil growing countries in the world are Malaysia, Nigeria, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.'
 '#### Harvesting, processing, storage, and transportation of oil palm:  \nThe fruits of the palm oil trees turn red when they are ripe and ready for harvesting. Each fruit consists of a fleshy pericarp surrounding a nut. Fruits are boiled in pots or drums at high temperature. The processing continues to the point where the pericarp is compressed to obtain palm oil. Inside the pericarp, there is a kernel which is also a source of oil. Oil from the kernel is obtained by crushing the nuts in a grinder and compressing them. The extracted palm oil is packed in containers ready for domestic use and export.'
 '#### Farm preparation, planting and care of oil palm:  \nFarm preparation takes place before transplanting. Palm oil seeds are sown in nurseries which are later transplanted to a farm when they are 12-14 months old. Palm oil plants begin bearing fruits when they are five years old and reach maximum production after 8-10 years. After ten years, yields start to decline. Palm fruits usually grow in large bunches.

32,"hello there, can you prepare a true or false assertion concerning mineral occurrences for the kids?","True or False: Tin, copper, silver, lead, manganese, and zinc are examples of minerals formed in veins and lodes.","['#### The occurrence of minerals:  \nThe occurrence of minerals falls into one of the four main types of modes of formation. These are veins and lodes, bed and seams, weathering products, and alluvial or place deposits. Veins and lodes are formed when molten materials containing minerals intrude and solidify into cracks and crevices. These are mainly associated with igneous and metamorphic intrusions. Examples of minerals formed in veins and lodes are tin, copper, silver, lead, manganese and zinc.  \nBed and seams constitute another type of mineral formation. Coal, iron ore, gypsum, potash, salts and common salts are formed as a direct result of deposition, accumulation and concentration in the horizontal strata of the earth’s crust. Gypsum, potash and salts, for example, are formed by the evaporation of lakes in desert areas and later are covered by other deposits so that they appear as seams.'
 '#### Mining  \nMining is a process of extracting valuable geological substances from the crust of the earth. The extracted materials may be minerals, fossil fuels, and other geological materials. However, not all geological substances are categorized as minerals. In science, a mineral has specific characteristics such as being solid, inorganic, naturally occurring, has definite chemical composition and ordered internal structure. Although oil, coal and natural gas do not possess most of these characteristics, they may be categorized as minerals. From a non-scientific view, a mineral refers to a non-living naturally occurring resource from the earth. As such, oil, coal, and natural gas also qualify to be called mineral resources. Thus, petroleum and natural gas which are discussed as case studies in this chapter are treated as minerals. Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water.'
 '#### Uses of some minerals  \nMinerals are used for different purposes. This part explains the uses of eight minerals. These minerals are tanzanite, copper, diamond, gold, iron, coal, petroleum and natural gas.  \n##### Tanzanite:  \nTanzanite is the blue and violet of the mineral ziosite caused by small amounts of vanadium, belonging to the epidote group. Tanzanite is only found in Tanzania in a very small mining area approximately 7 km near Mererani Hills in Arusha. It was discovered in 1967.  \nTanzanite is noted for its remarkably strong trichoism, appearing alternately as blue, violet and burgundy depending on crystal orientation. Tanzanite can also appear differently when viewed under different lighting conditions.  \nFigure 5.1 Distribution of minerals in Tanzania  \nFigure 5.2 Distribution of some major minerals in the world'

Natural gas is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, care has to be when extracting this resource. Natural gas production is new in Tanzania and, thus, it faces a shortage of skilled labour, especially in exploration and extraction activities. As a result, the government is often forced to employ foreign experts who are paid high salaries. Regarding the capacity to produce the natural gas, Tanzania has not been able to allocate enough funds for exploration, extraction, processing and distribution.'
 '#### Tanzania’s efforts in addressing the challenges of natural gas production  \nTanzania has been trying to overcome the challenges associated with the production of its natural gas. The government has been emphasising the use of revenue from natural gas to benefit the people in the areas producing the gas and the nation as a whole. The revenue from natural gas is used to improve social services in education and health. There have been various public programmes aimed to educate the public on natural gas benefits. The ministries responsible for energy and mineral resources in Tanzania conduct awareness creation programmes through various ways such as meetings and the media. The government also provides opportunities for training to Tanzanians in oil and natural gas. These training opportunities aim to build the country’s capacity for exploration, extraction, processing and supplying of natural gas.'
 'Tanzania benefits a lot from its natural gas resources. The resources benefit the economy of the country but also improve the lives of its people. Natural gas has contributed to the improvement of infrastructure. Transport and communication systems to and from source of natural gas areas have been improved. For example, the discovery and extraction of gas in Mtwara Region has stimulated improvement of the airport and the harbour in the region. As a result, air transport to and from Mtwara Region has also improved. Natural gas has also created the demand for labour, goods and services. There has been an increase in the demand for both skilled and unskilled labour to work in the mines and carry out mining-related activities. Moreover, natural gas extraction has added a source of income for the people. Companies involved in natural gas extraction usually pay taxes and other dues to the government. People living nearby natural gas extraction fields also benefit by selling goods,'
 'In Tanzania, natural gas is found in the southern parts of the country, particularly in Mtwara, Lindi, and Ruvuma regions. Specifically, natural gas is produced at Songosongo, Mnazi Bay, Msimbati, Kiliwani North, and Ntorya. Furthermore, exploration of natural gas and petroleum is going on in Tanzania and there are signs of their availability in other coastal regions and islands of Tanzania. In recent years, the exploration has indicated the availability of petroleum and natural gas in Pemba – Zanzibar.  \nThe major producers of petroleum and natural gas in the world include USA, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Russia, Nigeria, Gabon, Libya, Kuwait, Algeria, Angola, Venezuela, Mexico, and Egypt.'

Finally, you will learn about problems related to power and energy extraction in the USA and Tanzania.'
 '### The concept of Power and Energy  \nPower: Power is the flow of energy at any one time, and can be generated from renewable energy resources through solar conversion (solar, thermal electricity, solar heating); harnessing water (hydropower for electricity, wave and tidal generation through turbines); harnessing the wind (wind pumps for water, wind turbines for electricity); and a variety of other energy sources. The main power sources are petroleum (oil), natural gas, water, coal and nuclear. Other sources include the earth’s interior (hot springs), wind, sun, tides, and waves, wood, peat and cattle or cow dung (biogas).'
 'Power is found within our bodies, machines, in plants and bodies of animals, insects and birds. Power is also inherently present in natural forces like wind, tides, waves, and water whose movements can be utilized to drive machines, or generate electricity. In our daily lives, power is needed to cook food, to drive machinery in industrial plants, to provide light and heat, and to propel vehicles of different types.  \nEnergy: Energy can be defined as the capacity for, or equivalent of, doing work. Energy is the ability to work so as to produce motion. For example, when water turns a turbine, electricity is produced. Also energy is used to drive machines and provide heat and light.  \nThe society requires energy for transportation, heating and cooling of buildings, powering production processes in industry, and various household needs. Energy can be grouped into various types as explained below.'
 '### Importance of power and energy  \nThe following section explains why power and energy are important to human life.  \nRunning machines: Power and energy are used to run machines in industries and provide light at homes, schools, hospitals and other institutions. In the agricultural sector, energy is used to run farm machinery and equipment such as tractors and combine harvesters.  \nRaw materials: Some sources of energy are raw materials of some industries. For example, oil is a raw material for petrochemical and refinery industries in the making of plastics, medicines, clothes, and ropes.  \nTransport enhancement: Energy plays an important role in improving the transport sector because vehicles, locomotives, aircraft, and vessels use petrol or diesel.'
 'Renewable and non-renewable energy: Renewable energy is energy generated from sources that are essentially inexhaustible. Examples of renewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, geothermal energy, tidal power, and hydroelectric power. Non-renewable energy includes conventional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which are likely to get depleted with use.  \nConventional and non-conventional energy: Conventional energy is an energy source which is fixed in nature like oil, gas, coal, and hydropower generation. It is also termed as non-renewable energy or thermal energy. The conventional energy resources are being used extensively; as a result, their known reserves have been depleted to a great extent. The use of conventional energy has emerging effects on the environment. The non-conventional energy involves energy generated by wind, tides, solar and biomass. These are renewable sources of energy and not exhaustible.'

You will also learn about factors necessary for locating an industry, and pollutants from manufacturing industries. Besides, you will learn about the production of cars in Japan, electronic devices in South Korea and textiles in Tanzania.'
 '### The concept of manufacturing industry  \nThe manufacturing industry involves the processing and changing of raw materials into different semi-finished or finished products using tools and machines. It plays a major role in bringing about the development of a country. The ever-growing population with increased demands for goods and services is accommodated by the establishment of manufacturing industries. Such increased population demands more food, shelter, clothes and other services. The following section explains the importance of manufacturing industries in the world.'
 '### The importance of manufacturing industries:  \n- (a) Manufacturing industries are sources of employment for both skilled and unskilled labour. These employees can raise their standards of living and improve quality of life with the income they earn. The income they earn caters for basic needs such as food, shelter, clothes and education.\n- (b) Manufacturing industries also lead to the diversification of the country’s economy due to their potentials for promoting other sectors of the economy. This reduces over-dependence on one or two economic sectors, which can be affected by fluctuation of prices in the world market.\n- (c) Manufacturing industries enable countries to process locally produced raw materials before they are exported. This process helps to add value to the exports.'
 '- (d) Manufacturing industries stimulate the development of infrastructure such as railways and roads. These means of transport are useful in carrying raw materials to manufacturing centers and the finished or unfinished goods to the markets.\n- (e) Industries also help to create a large internal market as workers get wages and salaries from industries which enable them to buy goods and services. In fact, the more the workers, the larger the market for manufacturing industries.\n- (f) Manufacturing industries also lead to increased agricultural production. For example, the textile industry requires cotton as raw material. Thus, it can stimulate the expansion of cotton growing.\n- (g) Manufacturing industries are sources of foreign currency. The products manufactured in a country are exported to other countries for sale which, in turn, attract foreign currency.'

Different individuals or groups of people carry out different activities in different places. For example, the Maasai of Tanzania and Kenya practise nomadic pastoralism because of seasonal availability of pasture and water in an area. People in urban areas, on the other hand, engage in activities in industries and offices. Some people engage in providing services in education, administration, planning, and health.'
 '## Chapter One (Human Activities)  \n### Introduction  \nHuman activities refer to things that people do or cause to happen. Human beings do such activities for social, economic, and political purposes. In this chapter, you will learn about human activities, types of human activities, and the importance of such activities.'
 '### Importance of human activities  \nHuman activities are important in many ways. People are employed in different sectors depending on the kind of activities they can do. For example, in mining there are multi-national companies such as Williamson Diamonds and Barrick Gold (now known as Acacia), which employ many people. The companies also pay tax to the government. Moreover, employment in different human activities generate income which improves people’s standards of living.'
 '### Types of human activities  \nThere are three major categories of human activities. These are primary, secondary, and tertiary activities.'
 '#### Primary activities:  \nPrimary activities are done by people when they interact directly with the natural environment to obtain their essential needs. These activities include agriculture, forestry, mining, and fishing.  \n##### Agriculture:  \nAgriculture is an activity which involves crop cultivation and livestock-keeping. It is the oldest human activity which has been practised by all societies in the world. It provides food for households and raw materials for industries. The type of agriculture practised in a given place is determined by various conditions of the area including climate, water availability, soil characteristics and terrain. It is also influenced by financial resources, infrastructure, technology and conditions of the market.'

37,"Please, I need a detailed question for my form two students to explain the importance of Tourism in Tanzania.","Explain the factors that contribute to the development of tourism in Tanzania, providing specific examples of landmarks that attract tourists to the country.","['#### Factors for the development of tourism in Tanzania:  \nTanzania has a stable government, with peace and security which promote the tourism industry. In Tanzania, there are varieties of attractive sceneries including Mount Kilimanjaro, Ngorongoro Crater, Great Rift Valley and Amboni Caves. These landmarks contribute much to the development of tourism in the country. Others are Oldonyo Lengai and Mount Meru.'
 '##### Tourism  \nTourism is the movement of people within a country or from one country to another for the purpose of leisure, pleasure, studies, or trade. Tourism involves traveling to and staying in places outside the usual residence for a certain period. Tourists travel to see the beauty of wildlife, landscape, and man-made features. These features include wildlife conservation areas such as national parks and game reserves, beaches, and historic (heritage) and cultural sites. Beaches in Tanzania are found along the coast of the Indian Ocean and on shores of lakes Victoria, Tanganyika, and Nyasa.'
 'The improvement of transport and communication contributes to easy movement of tourists from one place to another. Tanzania is investing in improving airline transport to strengthen the tourism industry.  \nIn addition, Tanzania has adequate and comfortable accommodation to cater for tourists with different economic status, hence attracting a large number of tourists. Tanzania also has friendly and hospitable people. The country is also rich in cultural diversity with more than 120 ethnic groups. Each of these ethnic groups has its unique culture which presents a wide range of cultural tourist attractions. Tanzania is also well known and respected for its unique language, Kiswahili which is ever expanding in Africa and worldwide.'
 'Increase in population for settlement and agriculture expansion has led to encroachment on national parks and game reserves. This has led to degradation of wildlife areas, threatening their existence. In addition, crime and violent activities in some areas will discourage tourists from visiting such areas.  \n##### Promoting tourism in Tanzania:  \nThe following are the ways that can be used to promote tourism in Tanzania:  \n- Marketing strategies and publicity: Marketing of the tourism sector both domestically and internationally should be enhanced. There is a need for the government and other players in the industry to market aggressively the country’s tourist attractions in international media and forums.'

Also, both countries have set aside areas for ranching. In Australia, ranching is found at Victoria River, Alexandria Station and Anna Creek. These places are found in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and theNorthernTerritory. Examples of ranches in Tanzania are Kongwa, Ruvu, Kagera, Arusha, Morogoro, Kitulo and Lushoto.'
 'Livestock-keeping in Tanzania, on the contrary, is mainly for meeting domestic demands with some few animals and animal products being exported, but on a lower scale than in Australia. In Tanzania, sheep and goats are kept for meat and skins. Moreover, the application of science and technology in livestock-keeping is much more advanced in Australia than it is in Tanzania. The main rearing system of livestock-keeping in Tanzania is pastoralism and zero-grazing, whereas in Australia it is primarily the ranching system. In addition, Australia has many industries for processing animal products, whereas in Tanzania efforts are underway to establish such industries on a commercial scale.'
 '#### Differences between livestock-keeping in Tanzania and Australia:  \nLivestock-keeping in the two countries has the following differences: The majority of livestock in Australia is kept for commercial purposes. Australian sheep, particularly the Merino, are mainly kept for wool production. More than 60 percent of livestock products from Australia are exported to Europe and other continents.'
 'In both countries, dairy farming is practised where there is adequate water supply and plenty of pasture. Overall, the development of the livestock-keeping sector is important in both countries. Moreover, the two countries practise livestock at both the subsistence and commercial levels. The animals and their products can be used to meet family needs and sometimes be sold to raise revenue. In Tanzania, sedentary livestock-keeping is practised in densely populated areas and, hence, with a shortage of land such as the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro and the Southern Highlands whereas in Australia it is practised specifically in the South East of the country.'
 'In Tanzania and Australia livestock-keeping is important because it stimulates other sectors of the economy, for example, the development of transport and communication networks and processing industries such as leather and milk. Moreover, livestock-keeping promotes trade through selling animals and animal products within and outside these two countries. It also promotes employment to different people who work in processing industries. Livestock-keeping provides skins, hides, cheese, butter, milk, and meat. These products are sold and enable individual households and the nation to earn money. Furthermore, the sector generates revenue to these countries through tax collection from the industries operating in this livestock sector. It also encourages the use of marginal lands. Livestock-keeping, especially ranching and pastoralism, which need large open areas, make use of land which is otherwise not suitable for other uses. Farmers also apply cattle manure to add nutrients to the soil'

It contributes to the availability of food and raw materials. The sector also contributes to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The National Ranching Company (NARCO) is responsible for managing all public ranches in the country. Most of the livestock products are for the domestic market. This sub-sector needs to be developed particularly in dairy farming and its products and meat processing to meet the domestic demands and for export. Overall, livestock-keeping helps to reduce household poverty and ensure food security.'

41,"Please, I need a defining question about Traditional pastoralism for my students to answer briefly.",What are the advantages of nomadic pastoralism according to the textbook?,"['Nomadic pastoralism involves continual movement of pastoralists with large numbers of animals from place to place in search of pasture and water. People involved in this practice are called nomads or pastoralists. Tribes which practise nomadic pastoralism include the Maasai, Barbaig, Kwavi, and Karamajong. Nomadic pastoralism is mostly practised in sparsely populated areas where the natural vegetation is mainly grass and bushes and, sometimes, scattered trees. In these areas, rainfall is very low and unreliable. The pastoralists follow specific routes in their movements. Figure 2.10 shows a large herd of cattle. The animals kept by pastoralists are a source of food and income through the selling of animals and their products. Major products from animals are meat and milk. The pastoralists spend the money they earn to meet family needs such as buying cereals, paying school fees, and meeting health expenses. In addition, the cattle raised are used for paying bride price and giving gifts'
 '#### Advantages of nomadic pastoralism:  \n- Generally, managing livestock using traditional methods under nomadic pastoralism is cheap. It also ensures the availability of food to the family.\n- In addition, indigenous species of cattle such as Zebu, Boran, and Ankole are resistant to diseases.\n- Furthermore, the animals can tolerate walking over long distances and withstanding other environmental hardships such as high temperatures. They can also stay for a long time without water.\n- Likewise, the cattle are cheap to manage in terms of shelter.'
 '#### Characteristics of nomadic pastoralism:  \nThe nomads normally move in groups. These groups are formed through the integration of families or members of a given ethnic group. A group involves a chief or elders who make decisions for the entire group. Indeed, large herd tends to cause overgrazing. Overgrazing is a situation where the number of cattle is greater than the carrying capacity of the grazing land. As a result, overgrazing causes soil erosion, land degradation, and loss of valuable species. Another feature of the nomadic pastoralists is the breeding process, which is uncontrolled. This situation may lead to the spread and outbreak of animal diseases, hence low animal quality and deaths.  \nIn addition, there is poor control of pests and other diseases, which result to poor quality of animal products. Furthermore, nomadic pastoralism takes place where the population is scarce as the animals are grazed in open range, which needs a lot of space.'
 '#### Transhumance:  \nTranshumance is a seasonal movement of livestock from one grazing ground to another, specifically to lowlands in winter and highlands in summer. It is a form of semi-nomadic pastoralism in which domestic animals play a predominant but not an exclusive role in shaping the economic and cultural life of the people who depend on them.  \nUnder transhumance, pastoralism is a predominant economic activity with varying emphasis on agriculture as a supplementary activity. Countries that practise transhumance include Switzerland, Morocco, Kosovo and the Sudan-Sahelian zone of Mali.  \n##### Advantages of transhumance:'
 '#### Disadvantages of nomadic pastoralism:  \nNomadic pastoralism suffers from lack of processing and storage facilities, hence causing a significant loss of the products. Also, over-grazing under nomadic pastoralism leads to soil erosion. Moreover, the control of diseases is difficult since animals are always on the move, which can affect the health of the animals and lower productivity in the process. For example, there have been cases of loss of large numbers of livestock due to lack of water and pasture. This situation affects the economy of the pastoralists. Furthermore, the practise of nomadic pastoralism tends to cause conflicts as they interfere with crop cultivators’ land. Because of their nomadic nature, many of the pastoralists’ children fail to attend formal education. As such, their periodic movements result in many of these children being denied their right to education and associated opportunities.'
 'Explain what nomadic pastoralism means.'

The extracted minerals have a variety of industrial purposes: gold and silver are primarily used in jewelry and high-end electronics, iron is used to produce steel, copper is the main component of electrical wiring, lead is used in batteries, and zinc is used to coat iron and steel to reduce corrosion and as an alloy in the making of bronze and brass.'
 '#### Mining industry  \nMining is the branch of manufacturing industries and trade based on the extraction of ores, fossil fuels, minerals, stone, clay, gravel, and similar commodities. This does not include the refinement of these commodities. The mining industry contains five categories, which are defined by the resources they produce: oil and gas extraction, coal mining, metal ore mining, non-metallic mineral mining and quarrying, and support activities for mining.'
 '#### Mining  \nMining is a process of extracting valuable geological substances from the crust of the earth. The extracted materials may be minerals, fossil fuels, and other geological materials. However, not all geological substances are categorized as minerals. In science, a mineral has specific characteristics such as being solid, inorganic, naturally occurring, has definite chemical composition and ordered internal structure. Although oil, coal and natural gas do not possess most of these characteristics, they may be categorized as minerals. From a non-scientific view, a mineral refers to a non-living naturally occurring resource from the earth. As such, oil, coal, and natural gas also qualify to be called mineral resources. Thus, petroleum and natural gas which are discussed as case studies in this chapter are treated as minerals. Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water.'
 'There are two main types of mining, namely, surface and underground mining. Minerals such as salts are found close to the earth surface; as such, open cast method of mining is used to exploit them. Other minerals like gold and diamond are found deep in the ground, hence undergound mining methods are used to obtain them.  \nThe world is full of different types of minerals. Minerals can be classified into five main groups, that is, rocks used as building stones, and for brick making; non-metallic minerals such as salt, sulphur, nitrates, and asbestos; metals like gold, iron, and silver; mineral fuels including coal, petroleum and gas; and water. The whole of the earth, therefore, is full of minerals which are of great value to human beings.'
 'Surface mining is done by removing (stripping) surface vegetation, dirt, and, if necessary, layers of bedrock in order to reach buried ore deposits. Techniques of surface mining include: open-pit mining or open cast mining, which is the recovery of materials from an open pit in the ground; and quarrying, identical to open-pit mining except that it refers to sand, stone and clay. Open cast mining is the cheapest method of extracting minerals. This method is used to extract minerals which usually occur close to the earth’s surface. This method involves removing the top layers of the earth and other overlying materials above the mineral ores. Figure 5.3 shows an open cast mine. The extraction involves the use of earth moving machines and bulldozers, and electric shovels. Sometimes explosion is used to blow overlying materials in order to reach the ore beneath. This method is cheaper because the output is bigger than the costs of running. The open cast method is used to extract quarrying'

43,Need a describe question about variety of plant life for form two students classwork.,"**Describe the importance of forests in maintaining ecological and environmental balance, and provide examples to support your answer.**","['The leaves develop thorny leaves or a waxy surface to reduce loss of water through transpiration. Plants develop deep roots in the ground to reach water. Other plants develop storage organs. For example, a baobab tree stores water in its trunk. Some plants shed their leaves during periods of water scarcity. The relationship between vegetation and water supply may be influenced by human activities such as water drilling and deforestation. Water drilling may increase water supply in areas with water scarcity and, thus, influence the growth of the planted vegetation. On the other hand, deforestation exposes the area previously covered by the forest to evaporation and thus destroys the catchment areas. As a matter of fact, deforestation may turn an area into arid or semi-arid land.'
 'Soil: Soil contributes much to the distribution of forests. In this case, soil type, drainage, texture, permeability, porosity and chemical composition play a significant role in tree growth. For example, soil rich in humus encourages tree growth, which may turn into a forest. Regarding drainage, well-drained soils support a variety of trees whereas poorly drained soils such as swamps or steep slope areas with immature soil cannot support tree growth. For example, coastal tropical areas with sea alluvial salty water attract mangrove forests growth. Also, tropical rainforest trees require deep well-drained soils for proper binding together whereas coniferous trees have fibrous roots which can grow in shallow soils.'
 'During photosynthesis, oxygen is released by plants into the environment through the stomata, and this is used by animals. At the same time animals release carbon dioxide that is absorbed by the plants. By doing so, a balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide in the environment is maintained. Forests provide suitable habitats for wildlife and, therefore, contribute to the balance of ecosystem. Various animals live in the forest which gives them shelter and food as they eat leaves, roots and fruits. Moreover, forests help to control soil erosion as they protect the soil from being eroded by blowing wind and running water. Trees in the forest bind together the soil particles using roots, and reduce the impact of raindrops with the same roots. Plant leaves reduce the impact of rain drops on the soil and reduce excessive evaporation of soil water.'
 'Medicinal value: Some forest trees have medicinal value. They have roots, leaves, and bark which are used as medicine or processed to make medicine for human beings and animals. For example, the bark of the cinchona tree is used in manufacturing quinine which is useful for treatment of malaria. Also, some trees are used in making herbicides for use in agriculture.  \nTourist attraction: Some forests have rare and unique species of animals and plants which attract people to observe. For example, Gombe Forests in Kigoma have chimpanzees, which are a great attraction for both local and foreign tourists. Many of the natural parks have forests that serve as habitats for attracting animals and plants.  \nRainfall formation: Areas with heavy forests are characterised by frequent rainfall. For example, in the Amazon forests, 30 percent of rainfall is said to be influenced by moist air from trees.'
 '#### Importance of forests in ecological and environmental balance  \nEcology is the way in which plants, animals and people relate to each other and to their environment. Ecological and environmental balance is the mutual symbiotic system or state in which plants and animals benefit from each other, thus maintaining their survival in the environment. Plants, insects and animals live together in a particular environment. They live a symbiotic relationship by benefiting from each other.

In many cases, the major constraint common to all the weaknesses identified in the management of road safety is the lack of adequate financial resources. The poor safety record of many East African airlines is another area of major concern in Africa.'
 '- Liberalisation and privatisation in rail, air, and maritime transport are still in their infancy: Efforts to harmonise policies and regulations pertaining to cross-border movement of goods, services, and people have yet to become effective. Therefore, the East African countries have not fully implemented agreements aimed to facilitate cross-border movement of goods and passengers.  \n- Lack or poor transport network connectivity: The transport sector in East Africa suffers from a poor transport etwork which is characterised by several missing transport networks in each country and between countries. As a result, the majority of rural population live without access to markets and essential economic and social services. In addition, a large proportion of the transport network is also in poor state.'
 '- Inadequate human and institutional capacity: Although the number of workers in East African public transport enterprises and agencies is relatively high, the availability of skilled personnel is limited in most transport organisations. In addition to lack of adequate skilled human resources, institutions also lack people with appropriate knowledge and skills to plan, and manage infrastructural development and services.\n- High transport costs: East Africa is one of the regions with the highest transport costs in the world. Transport services are unaffordable to many African citizens.'
 '### Importance of the transport industry in East Africa:  \nThe transport industry is important for the socio-economic development of East African countries.

45,I need a long-answer question about Tanzania's strategies for dealing with natural gas challenges,"How does the Tanzanian government address the challenges associated with natural gas production, and what strategies are implemented to maximize the benefits of natural gas for the country and its people?","['#### Tanzania’s efforts in addressing the challenges of natural gas production  \nTanzania has been trying to overcome the challenges associated with the production of its natural gas. The government has been emphasising the use of revenue from natural gas to benefit the people in the areas producing the gas and the nation as a whole. The revenue from natural gas is used to improve social services in education and health. There have been various public programmes aimed to educate the public on natural gas benefits. The ministries responsible for energy and mineral resources in Tanzania conduct awareness creation programmes through various ways such as meetings and the media. The government also provides opportunities for training to Tanzanians in oil and natural gas. These training opportunities aim to build the country’s capacity for exploration, extraction, processing and supplying of natural gas.'
 '#### Challenges of natural gas production in Tanzania:  \nNatural gas production faces numerous challenges in different aspects. Natural gas is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, care has to be when extracting this resource. Natural gas production is new in Tanzania and, thus, it faces a shortage of skilled labour, especially in exploration and extraction activities. As a result, the government is often forced to employ foreign experts who are paid high salaries. Regarding the capacity to produce the natural gas, Tanzania has not been able to allocate enough funds for exploration, extraction, processing and distribution.'
 'Tanzania benefits a lot from its natural gas resources. The resources benefit the economy of the country but also improve the lives of its people. Natural gas has contributed to the improvement of infrastructure. Transport and communication systems to and from source of natural gas areas have been improved. For example, the discovery and extraction of gas in Mtwara Region has stimulated improvement of the airport and the harbour in the region. As a result, air transport to and from Mtwara Region has also improved. Natural gas has also created the demand for labour, goods and services. There has been an increase in the demand for both skilled and unskilled labour to work in the mines and carry out mining-related activities. Moreover, natural gas extraction has added a source of income for the people. Companies involved in natural gas extraction usually pay taxes and other dues to the government. People living nearby natural gas extraction fields also benefit by selling goods,'
 'In Tanzania, natural gas is found in the southern parts of the country, particularly in Mtwara, Lindi, and Ruvuma regions. Specifically, natural gas is produced at Songosongo, Mnazi Bay, Msimbati, Kiliwani North, and Ntorya. Furthermore, exploration of natural gas and petroleum is going on in Tanzania and there are signs of their availability in other coastal regions and islands of Tanzania. In recent years, the exploration has indicated the availability of petroleum and natural gas in Pemba – Zanzibar.  \nThe major producers of petroleum and natural gas in the world include USA, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Russia, Nigeria, Gabon, Libya, Kuwait, Algeria, Angola, Venezuela, Mexico, and Egypt.'
 '### Addressing challenges to power and energy harnessing in Tanzania:  \nDespite the challenges to harnessing power and energy, the following are some of the solutions to the challenges facing power and energy harnessing in Tanzania.  \nAlternative sources of power: Alternative sources of power to support the existing sources should be explored to meet the increasing power demand in Tanzania. By 2013, the annual power demand increase was between 10 percent and 15 percent. The demand for power and energy is expected to increase because of the new industries that are to be constructed.  \nFunds allocation for exploration: The government is required to allocate adequate funds for exploring other sources of power. Tanzania is endowed with many power and energy sources, which have not been yet harnessed due to lack of capital.  \nTraining of skilled personnel: More young Tanzanians should be trained on HEP and biogas exploration and production.'

Manufacturing contributes to air and water pollution for example the Wazo Hill Cement industry in Dar es Salaam.'
 '### Pollutants from manufacturing industries:  \nIndustrial pollutants are substances that make air, water and soil harmful to living organisms. The manufacturing industries produce different pollutants which are dangerous to human health and the environment. These pollutants are categorized as gas, solids, liquids and noise.'
 '#### Air pollution:  \nPollution can easily be observed from oil refining industries. These manufacturing industries use heat from coal or diesel furnaces to provide steam power to run the plants. Burning this fuel can also release pollutants into the air.'
 '#### Gases:  \nIndustrial activities produce harmful gases that pollute the environment. Such gases are sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon dioxide, methane and other hydrocarbons. The gases emitted may cause respiratory and skin diseases. Sulphur dioxide can form sulphuric acid when it comes into contact with water in the atmosphere to form acid rain. Such rain corrodes rocks, iron sheets and pollute soils, lakes and rivers. Carbon dioxide is produced due to incomplete combustion of gases, oil, coal and wood. The high concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes global warming.'
 'Oil production in the Middle East faces many challenges. With rising global demand, highly volatile prices are increasingly becoming stringent. The oil and gas industry faces three major challenges involving how to reduce costs, optimize the performance of its industrial base assets, and address its environmental footprint. Environmental pollution is one of these challenges. Oil refinery and production of petroleum products produce carbon dioxide and other gases such as methane which are harmful. As countries in the Middle East have large oil production industries, the emission of harmful gases is also high. These gases contribute to the pollution of water, air, and land. Burning fossil fuels produces sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. When they move into the atmosphere they produce acid rain, which damages buildings and vegetation in addition to affecting fish and other organisms that live in water.

It is a form of semi-nomadic pastoralism in which domestic animals play a predominant but not an exclusive role in shaping the economic and cultural life of the people who depend on them.  \nUnder transhumance, pastoralism is a predominant economic activity with varying emphasis on agriculture as a supplementary activity. Countries that practise transhumance include Switzerland, Morocco, Kosovo and the Sudan-Sahelian zone of Mali.  \n##### Advantages of transhumance:'
 '##### Advantages of transhumance:  \nTranshumance has several advantages including an attempt to maximise productivity by exploiting annual grazing imbalances. This ensures the availability of pasture to feed the animals throughout the year. It also enhances income earning from the sale of pastoral products. In addition, it stimulates considerable national, regional and international trade. Transhumance provides raw materials such as dairy and non-wood forest products for local industries. Moreover, it provides services to other sectors of the economy, thus serving as a complementary resource for the country’s overall economy. It also offers many jobs for pastoral communities and a diversity of actors involved in the livestock marketing circuit and value chain for other products.  \n##### Disadvantages of transhumance:'
 '##### Disadvantages of transhumance:  \nTranshumance has disadvantages as it accelerates deforestation (as the case of southern regions of Mali), causes damage to crops, increases conflicts and contributes to natural resource degradation.  \n##### Sedentary livestock-keeping:  \nSedentary livestock-keeping involves keeping animals in a permanent place. In fact, this type of keeping animals is called sedentary when livestock are permanently held in an area. Sedentary livestock-keeping is also known as zero grazing. This type livestock-keeping is characterised by a small number of animals that are kept in sheds.  \n##### Advantages of sedentary livestock-keeping:'
 'Livestock-keeping is categorized into traditional or subsistence and modern or commercial livestock-keeping. Categories of traditional livestock-keeping are nomadic, semi-nomadic, transhumance, and sedentary. Traditional or subsistence livestock-keeping is practised in arid areas that receive less rainfall per annum. These places do not support crop production. Ethnic groups that engage in traditional livestock-keeping are the Maasai, Sukuma, and Barbaig of Tanzania. In Uganda, it is mostly practised by the Karamajong. In Kenya, it is practised by the Maasai, the Turkana, and the Samburu.'
 'Nomadic pastoralism involves continual movement of pastoralists with large numbers of animals from place to place in search of pasture and water. People involved in this practice are called nomads or pastoralists. Tribes which practise nomadic pastoralism include the Maasai, Barbaig, Kwavi, and Karamajong. Nomadic pastoralism is mostly practised in sparsely populated areas where the natural vegetation is mainly grass and bushes and, sometimes, scattered trees. In these areas, rainfall is very low and unreliable. The pastoralists follow specific routes in their movements. Figure 2.10 shows a large herd of cattle. The animals kept by pastoralists are a source of food and income through the selling of animals and their products. Major products from animals are meat and milk. The pastoralists spend the money they earn to meet family needs such as buying cereals, paying school fees, and meeting health expenses. In addition, the cattle raised are used for paying bride price and giving gifts'

There are four methods of mining which are surface, underground, alluvial, and in-situ mining.'
 'Surface mining is done by removing (stripping) surface vegetation, dirt, and, if necessary, layers of bedrock in order to reach buried ore deposits. Techniques of surface mining include: open-pit mining or open cast mining, which is the recovery of materials from an open pit in the ground; and quarrying, identical to open-pit mining except that it refers to sand, stone and clay. Open cast mining is the cheapest method of extracting minerals. This method is used to extract minerals which usually occur close to the earth’s surface. This method involves removing the top layers of the earth and other overlying materials above the mineral ores. Figure 5.3 shows an open cast mine. The extraction involves the use of earth moving machines and bulldozers, and electric shovels. Sometimes explosion is used to blow overlying materials in order to reach the ore beneath. This method is cheaper because the output is bigger than the costs of running. The open cast method is used to extract quarrying'
 '#### Mining  \nMining is a process of extracting valuable geological substances from the crust of the earth. The extracted materials may be minerals, fossil fuels, and other geological materials. However, not all geological substances are categorized as minerals. In science, a mineral has specific characteristics such as being solid, inorganic, naturally occurring, has definite chemical composition and ordered internal structure. Although oil, coal and natural gas do not possess most of these characteristics, they may be categorized as minerals. From a non-scientific view, a mineral refers to a non-living naturally occurring resource from the earth. As such, oil, coal, and natural gas also qualify to be called mineral resources. Thus, petroleum and natural gas which are discussed as case studies in this chapter are treated as minerals. Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water.'
 'Source: http://ilovekageratanzania.blogspot.com  \n##### Mining:  \nMining is the process of extracting minerals from the crust of the Earth. Mining is done on both small and large scales.

5,Can you create a true or false statement about traditional fallowing techniques for my students?,"True or False: In bush fallowing, people have permanent settlements and the farm is left to regain its fertility for nearly ten years before cultivating a fresh area.","['Small-scale crop cultivation is done by using different methods such as shifting cultivation, crop rotation, and bush fallowing.'
 '#### Bush fallowing:  \nBush fallowing is not different from shifting cultivation in that in bush fallowing people have permanent settlements. They clear the bush, burn the vegetation, and sow seeds. Yield declines after three to five years. The farm is left to regain its fertility for nearly ten years. Another bush is cleared and cultivated. No movement is involved in bush fallowing. This is possible in areas with dense population. Small-scale crop cultivation is advantageous to farmers. It allows them to grow varieties of food crops. Different crops grown in small farms make it easy to control pests and diseases. Elementary tools such as pangas, hand hoes and axes lead to low cost of running the farms, hence low capital involved. Farmers depend on rainfall only which is unreliable hence, during droughts the farmers suffer from famine.'
 'This is a traditional system of cultivation used in tropical rainforest and miombo wooded savanna. It operates where the population is sparse. People farm and move to another fresh area when the yields are low. The cultivator or farmer burns the forest and sows seeds in the intermixed ash and soil. Little attention is given to the crops until they ripen. If the harvest declines, the land is abandoned, and a fresh area is cleared. The yields decline after three to five years. The cultivator may return to the original land after some years. The constant moves ensure fresh land with high yields, as the land is fertile. There is no serious soil erosion since only a small area is exposed which supports many crops and therefore little bare earth is seen. Any soil washed is trapped by dense plant roots and at the forest edge. The system is less risky of diseases. The methods used in shifting cultivation differ with people’s culture and the varieties of crops they grow. Some use fire to clear'
 '#### Disadvantages of small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop cultivation is associated with loss of soil fertility due to overuse of the same plots of land. Moreover, the practice of burning vegetation during farm preparation tends to destroy soil nutrients, hence lower its fertility. As a result, subsistence or peasant farmers’ yields tend to fall. Such low yields are also contributed by low use of fertilisers and pesticides. Therefore, various ways are needed to reduce the challenges of small-scale crop cultivation.'
 'River basin development also attracts irrigation. Due to the availability of water in a basin, commercial agriculture is established through irrigation schemes. Sometimes, individual peasants use a well-managed river basin for watering their small farms using traditional mechanisms such as buckets. In addition, river basin development projects involve planting of trees and construction of dams. They also involve strict measures for prohibiting deforestation and poor cultivation practises. All these measures aim to foster appropriate use of the land to keep it productive. These measures also enable the preservation of the ecosystem. By doing so, these projects contribute to preventing the land from being eroded by environmental problems such as soil erosion, floods and loss of soil fertility.'

6,Need an explaining question on economic impacts of agriculture in USA,What are some of the economic impacts of agriculture in the United States of America according to the provided context information?,"['Agriculture, which is highly mechanised, operates on a large-scale and makes a significant contribution to the USA economy through provision of employment opportunities to about 11% of the Americans. Through agriculture the country also earns foreign currency, which helps to increase the National Domestic Product (NDP) through the export of beverages and other processed foods. Improvement of standards of living of the people who live near plantations such as the Cotton and Corn belts is another contribution of large-scale agriculture in the USA. Furthermore, the country has benefited significantly from development and growth of beef and dairy farming industries, which employ the largest percentage, followed by bakery, fruit and vegetable plants. The agricultural sector also plays a role in stimulating the development and growth of towns and cities such as Chicago and St. Louis.'
 '### Challenges facing large-scale agriculture in USA:  \nThere are several challenges facing large-scale agriculture in the USA. Some of them are high cost of production as agriculture in the USA is highly mechanised. Automatic irrigation and agricultural machinery require fossil fuels and other sources of energy to run them. The increase in the price of fossil fuel, therefore, increases the cost of production. At times, there is a shortage of water as irrigation requires a lot of water. The amount of underground water drawn for irrigation is increasing whereas the amount of water to refill is decreasing; which results in shortage of water for agricultural use. Another problem has to do with loss of soil fertility as the soil is eroded faster than it can be replenished due to over- cultivation. Also, over-irrigation causes leaching of soil nutrients.'
 '### Contribution of crop production to the economy of the United States of America  \nThe United States of America (USA) has a diverse climate and the ability to grow a wide variety of crops across the vast country with 50 states. Agriculture is a major industry in the USA, which is a net exporter of food. Although agricultural activity occurs in every state, it is particularly concentrated in the Great Plains, a vast expanse of flat, arable land at the center of the nation in the region around the Great Lakes known as the Corn Belt. Corn is another name for maize which is a chief cereal crop. The economy of the USA heavily depends on manufacturing industries. However, it is so diversified and characterized with a variety of sectors including services, entertainment, telecommunications and agriculture.'
 '### The concept of agriculture  \nAgriculture is a science which deals with crop cultivation and livestock keeping. It is the oldest human activity which has been practiced by many societies in the world. Through agriculture, human beings grow crops for use by households and supply to industries. Factors influencing agriculture include climate, water availability, soil characteristics and terrain. Agriculture is also influenced by availability of financial resources, infrastructure, technology and markets.'
 'The majority of Tanzanians heavily depend on agriculture. It is estimated that 75% of the population is engaged in agriculture. It has played a significant role in improving people’s lives. It has stimulated the development of industries especially those related to the processing of tea, fruits, sisal and sugar-cane, among others. The sector has also led to the creation of employment opportunities in the country as many people are employed in agro-related industries whereas others are self-employed. Furthermore, the sector has contributed to the generation of government revenue and capital development in form of tax and duty payment as well as exports. It has also stimulated external trade and international relations through the exportation of cash crops to earn foreign currency. It has contributed to the development of transport and communication system from the farm to the market and from the market to the farm. Additionally, it has encouraged the raising of the standard of living'

7,Can you help to make a true or false statement about how mining can reduce its environmental impacts for form 2 geography?,True or False: One of the ways to minimize the effects of mining on the environment is through proper storage and use of chemicals.,"['- Effects of the mining industry on the environment: Mining and processing activities have negative effects on the environment if not done carefully. The sections below describe some of the effects of mining on the environment.\n- Pollution: Mining activities can lead to water, air, and noise pollution. To begin with, mining produces waste materials which pollute water bodies. For example, chemicals used in processing minerals such as mercury and sodium cyanide can pollute rivers, lakes, and underground water. This may cause the loss of life of living organisms, which depend on water. Large amounts of dust released into the air affect people, plants, and animals found in nearby areas. Also, the blasting process causes noise and vibration which affect people and their properties in nearby areas.'
 '### Ways of minimising the effects of mining on the environment:  \nThe following are ways to minimise the effects of mining on the environment:  \n- Land rehabilitation: Holes produced during mining should be covered with the removed soils. Planting trees and other vegetation cover helps to repair the damaged land.\n- Proper storage and use of chemicals: It is advisable to store chemicals in a strong room so that no leakage occurs into the soil and water. Moreover, chemicals are to be used with care to avoid polluting soil and water resources.\n- Waste management: There must be a proper waste disposal from mineral processing industries. This organised disposal includes treatment of the chemicals that flow from the industries into rivers and streams. In addition, there should be dust management programmes to avoid air pollution.'
 '- Deforestation and loss of biodiversity: Large-scale mining involves clearing of forests and any other vegetation cover. The clearance of vegetation causes the loss of different plant and animal species. Mining causes direct and indirect damage to wild animals by altering their habitats. This may lead to the disappearance of various wildlife species such as birds and other animals.\n- Loss of soil productivity: Rocky soils left behind after mining cannot support crop production because they have low fertility. In fact, the soil structure and texture is destroyed when it mixes with particles of rocks.\n- Effects on the water table: Deep mining that reaches the water table may cause underground water to flood the mines. As a result, the water has to be pumped out to allow mining to continue. Continued pumping of this underground water lowers the water table of the area.'
 '- Safety education: Mining companies are required to provide safety education to workers and the communities surrounding the mining areas. Such education may include wearing of protective gear (helmets, gloves, overalls, glasses and masks). This protects the workers from accidents associated with mining activities. The community has to be educated on the importance of reporting any environmental problem they experience as a result of mining activities.\n- Mining regulations: The government should enforce mining and environmental laws and regulations that guide mining and mineral processing activities, to reduce the negative effects of mining.'
 'Inadequate capital for exploration: Exploration of sources of power and their harnessing is supposed to be a continuous activity. However, exploration demands large injection of capital, which is not readily available particularly in developing countries. Inadequate funds for the exploration of power sources and their harnessing has been a recurrent problem in Tanzania. There is generally little or no establishment of new sources of energy. As a result, there has been over-dependence on the same sources of power and energy, mainly HEP and natural gas.  \nHuman activities: Human activities such as construction and cultivation expose soil to running water. This water carries silt which is deposited in the dam causing siltation. Siltation usually reduces the capacity of dams to store water, which in turn affects production of HEP.'

It is, therefore, important to have trained personnel who can offer quality services to meet international standards. This, in turn, will lead to increased influx of tourists.\n- Development of tourist attractions: The government should invest in expanding the tourist attractions in the country. This can be done by opening up new areas and diversifying tourist activities but also by promoting them as viable alternatives.\n- Improvement of infrastructure: There is a need to improve the existing accommodation, transport and communication infrastructure. This will improve the provision of services needed by tourists in the hospitality industry.'
 '### Factors for the development and growth of tourism in the world  \nThe following are factors for the development and growth of tourism. These factors are features that encourage tourists to visit places for leisure, pleasure or education.  \n- Tourist attractions: Tourist attractions include places with pleasant climate, beautiful and varied sceneries, different cultures, historical sites and monuments. Also, some features in Tanzania such as Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest free-standing mountain in the world, attract tourists.\n- Advancement in communication and transportation network: Reliable communication network and advanced technology encourage the development of tourism in a country. For example, the use of the internet, television programmes, and social media, tourism trade fair and exhibitions has facilitated availability of information on tourism, hence it has led to an influx of tourists.'
 '### The concept of tourism  \nTourism is a temporary movement of people to places of interest for leisure, pleasure, studies and trade or business, outside their normal working stations or home. A tourist is a person who travels to different places for leisure. Tourism can be classified as either domestic or international. Domestic tourism comprises of tourists who travel within their own country. For example, if a Tanzanian living in Iringa visits Serengeti National Park he or she is a domestic tourist. International tourism, on the other hand, comprises of tourists who travel from their country to another country. For example, people from Switzerland can travel to Tanzania to visit national parks such as the Serengeti, Mikumi or Ruaha.'
 'Also, roads, railways, airports and hotels, are attractively constructed and maintained to sustain the tourism industry. For example, transport means to tourist attraction centers in Tanzania such as the Serengeti, Mikumi, and Mount Kilimanjaro national parks as well as Bagamoyo historical sites are well developed. Tourism has also encouraged increase in production in other sectors to meet the tourist needs. For example, other sectors such as transport, agriculture, trade and commerce are highly favoured.'
 'Tourism services also generate the much-needed foreign currency. Tourists arrive in the country with convertible currencies which boost the country’s foreign currency. Moreover, taxes from this sector contribute to the growth of the national economy. This, in turn, lead to the development of other sectors such as health, education, infrastructure and water. Furthermore, existing roads are improved and new ones are built to connect tourist attraction sites. Airports are also developed and improved. Communication infrastructure is also improved to serve these areas.'

9,"Give me a long answer question about wind patterns, where students must describe in detail.",Explain the process of harnessing wind energy using wind turbines.,"['Wind energy: Wind energy refers to the energy that is generated from wind. Wind mills have been used for hundreds of years to pump water from the ground. Currently, wind turbines are used to generate electricity. Wind is the second most frequently applied energy source in the world with a total installed capacity of 539.123 Gigawatt (GW) in 2017. Before harnessing wind energy, research on variables such as speed, direction, and persistency is necessary. Thereafter, wind turbines have to be set. A wind turbine operates on the following simple principles:  \n1. The power from the wind turns the windmill that has two or three propeller-like blades around a rotor.\n2. The motor is connected to a main shaft that spins a generator to generate energy. Figure 8.1 shows a windmill farm.'
 '#### Wind:  \nWind affects evapotranspiration by keeping air in constant movement. This movement increases the rate of evapotranspiration as it clears any humidity around the plants, hence increasing the rate of transpiration.'
 'Solar energy is harnessed on a large- scale in the states of California, Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina, New Jersey and Massachusetts. These areas are more conducive for harnessing solar power because of the sunny climate, clear skies and plenty of land. The electricity generated is integrated into the US National Grid.  \nWind energy is also used more in USA compared to solar energy. The country has a big potential of onshore and offshore winds. Wind energy is used in running large farms and industries. The leading wind energy producing centers are California, Oklahoma, Illinois, and Kansas. Wind power generation and use in USA is expanding quickly. It experiences an annual growth of 25.6 percent. For example, in 2017, wind power generated 6.3 percent of electricity in the USA.'
 'Power is found within our bodies, machines, in plants and bodies of animals, insects and birds. Power is also inherently present in natural forces like wind, tides, waves, and water whose movements can be utilized to drive machines, or generate electricity. In our daily lives, power is needed to cook food, to drive machinery in industrial plants, to provide light and heat, and to propel vehicles of different types.  \nEnergy: Energy can be defined as the capacity for, or equivalent of, doing work. Energy is the ability to work so as to produce motion. For example, when water turns a turbine, electricity is produced. Also energy is used to drive machines and provide heat and light.  \nThe society requires energy for transportation, heating and cooling of buildings, powering production processes in industry, and various household needs. Energy can be grouped into various types as explained below.'
 'Cost of installation: The initial installation cost of solar infrastructures sis high. US government subsidises solar installation. This enables many people interested in this energy to afford the cost.  \nTransmission costs: Although a certain amount of wind may be available everywhere, not all wind speeds are favourable to produce wind energy. There are specific sites with the potential for wind energy production. These sites are often located in remote locations far from cities, hence making transmission of energy for use expensive.  \nLand use: Harnessing wind power tends to compete with alternative uses of land. For example, a place with strong winds, which may be considered to have the potential for harnessing wind energy may also be important for industrial development. Both are important uses of the land, hence deciding on the best use of the site might not be easy.'

10,can you provide a describe question on types of commercial farming,Describe the characteristics of large-scale crop cultivation as a form of commercial agriculture.,"['### Large-scale crop cultivation:  \nLarge-scale crop cultivation is a farming system that covers a large area of land to produce one type of crop for commercial purposes. This type of large-scale farming is also known as commercial agriculture.  \nIn large-scale crop cultivation, the type of farming practise is mostly monoculture, in which a single crop is produced in large quantities. In developing countries monoculture is associated with tropical and sub-tropical plantation which were established through European colonisation. After independence of individual countries, the plantations were owned by government and others were allocated to individuals as small holders and peasant farmers. These plantations also known as estates are large and found in sparsely populated areas.'
 '#### Characteristics of large-scale crop cultivation:  \nLarge-scale crop cultivation is characterized by cultivation of a large area with the application of high level of technology. The technology involves the use of tractors, combine harvesters, and processing machines. As large-scale farming is highly mechanized, it employs few skilled people because machines carry out agricultural activities that otherwise could have been done manually by humans.  \nIn addition, such commercial farming is capital-intensive to support the production. Also, it is often based on a single crop, a practise known as monoculture. Chemical fertilisers are highly used to maximise yields. Large-scale agriculture is basically a source of raw materials for different manufacturing industries.  \nFigure 2.1 Coffee plant berries  \nsource:https/www.gettyimages.com/photo/coffee-plant'
 'Agriculture can be done by individual farmers, companies, or co-operative societies. Crop farming is the type of agriculture that involves the cultivation of land to produce crops. Crop farming can be practised to produce food crops and cash crops.  \nFood crops include rice, beans, cassava, maize, wheat, bananas, and potatoes whereas cash crops include sisal, coffee, tea, and cashew-nuts. Figure 1.1 shows a rice paddy.  \nFigure 1.1 Rice paddy  \nSource: Mwakalinga 03 June 2016: ippmedia.com'
 '### Commercial livestock-keeping  \nCommercial livestock-keeping involves rearing of animals for the purpose of selling their products such as meat, milk, wool and hides. Ranching, as part of commercial livestock-keeping, is mostly practised in more remote areas where land is extensive and population density is low. Extensive land provides sufficient grass to support a large number of animals. Commercial livestock-keeping is determined by factors such as capital, level of technology, market, availability of pasture and climatic conditions. In temperate regions, supplementary food such as hay and root crops are used to feed them during winter. Animals are kept for meat (beef cattle), for milk (dairy cattle and camel) and for wool (sheep).'
 '#### Characteristics of commercial livestock-keeping  \nCommercial livestock-keeping takes place on a large area with low population density. More space is needed for the construction of ranches and growing grass for feeding livestock. Generally, commercial livestock-keeping is practiced in more remote areas where other forms of land use are limited. Usually, one type of animal is kept for quality control of products. In addition, commercial livestock-keeping is capital-intensive as it demands money for buying land, paying for labor, fencing, and buying machines and equipment. Furthermore, crossbreeding in commercial livestock-keeping is an important management practice.'

11,"hello, can you help me create a discussion question for students to explain the characteristics of nomadic pastoralism.",Explain how overgrazing can negatively impact the environment and the livelihood of nomadic pastoralists.,"['#### Characteristics of nomadic pastoralism:  \nThe nomads normally move in groups. These groups are formed through the integration of families or members of a given ethnic group. A group involves a chief or elders who make decisions for the entire group. Indeed, large herd tends to cause overgrazing. Overgrazing is a situation where the number of cattle is greater than the carrying capacity of the grazing land. As a result, overgrazing causes soil erosion, land degradation, and loss of valuable species. Another feature of the nomadic pastoralists is the breeding process, which is uncontrolled. This situation may lead to the spread and outbreak of animal diseases, hence low animal quality and deaths.  \nIn addition, there is poor control of pests and other diseases, which result to poor quality of animal products. Furthermore, nomadic pastoralism takes place where the population is scarce as the animals are grazed in open range, which needs a lot of space.'
 'Nomadic pastoralism involves continual movement of pastoralists with large numbers of animals from place to place in search of pasture and water. People involved in this practice are called nomads or pastoralists. Tribes which practise nomadic pastoralism include the Maasai, Barbaig, Kwavi, and Karamajong. Nomadic pastoralism is mostly practised in sparsely populated areas where the natural vegetation is mainly grass and bushes and, sometimes, scattered trees. In these areas, rainfall is very low and unreliable. The pastoralists follow specific routes in their movements. Figure 2.10 shows a large herd of cattle. The animals kept by pastoralists are a source of food and income through the selling of animals and their products. Major products from animals are meat and milk. The pastoralists spend the money they earn to meet family needs such as buying cereals, paying school fees, and meeting health expenses. In addition, the cattle raised are used for paying bride price and giving gifts'
 '#### Disadvantages of nomadic pastoralism:  \nNomadic pastoralism suffers from lack of processing and storage facilities, hence causing a significant loss of the products. Also, over-grazing under nomadic pastoralism leads to soil erosion. Moreover, the control of diseases is difficult since animals are always on the move, which can affect the health of the animals and lower productivity in the process. For example, there have been cases of loss of large numbers of livestock due to lack of water and pasture. This situation affects the economy of the pastoralists. Furthermore, the practise of nomadic pastoralism tends to cause conflicts as they interfere with crop cultivators’ land. Because of their nomadic nature, many of the pastoralists’ children fail to attend formal education. As such, their periodic movements result in many of these children being denied their right to education and associated opportunities.'
 '#### Advantages of nomadic pastoralism:  \n- Generally, managing livestock using traditional methods under nomadic pastoralism is cheap. It also ensures the availability of food to the family.\n- In addition, indigenous species of cattle such as Zebu, Boran, and Ankole are resistant to diseases.\n- Furthermore, the animals can tolerate walking over long distances and withstanding other environmental hardships such as high temperatures. They can also stay for a long time without water.\n- Likewise, the cattle are cheap to manage in terms of shelter.'

The resources benefit the economy of the country but also improve the lives of its people. Natural gas has contributed to the improvement of infrastructure. Transport and communication systems to and from source of natural gas areas have been improved. For example, the discovery and extraction of gas in Mtwara Region has stimulated improvement of the airport and the harbour in the region. As a result, air transport to and from Mtwara Region has also improved. Natural gas has also created the demand for labour, goods and services. There has been an increase in the demand for both skilled and unskilled labour to work in the mines and carry out mining-related activities. Moreover, natural gas extraction has added a source of income for the people. Companies involved in natural gas extraction usually pay taxes and other dues to the government.

The government has been emphasising the use of revenue from natural gas to benefit the people in the areas producing the gas and the nation as a whole. The revenue from natural gas is used to improve social services in education and health. There have been various public programmes aimed to educate the public on natural gas benefits. The ministries responsible for energy and mineral resources in Tanzania conduct awareness creation programmes through various ways such as meetings and the media. The government also provides opportunities for training to Tanzanians in oil and natural gas. These training opportunities aim to build the country’s capacity for exploration, extraction, processing and supplying of natural gas.'
 '#### Challenges of natural gas production in Tanzania:  \nNatural gas production faces numerous challenges in different aspects. Natural gas is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, care has to be when extracting this resource. Natural gas production is new in Tanzania and, thus, it faces a shortage of skilled labour, especially in exploration and extraction activities. As a result, the government is often forced to employ foreign experts who are paid high salaries. Regarding the capacity to produce the natural gas, Tanzania has not been able to allocate enough funds for exploration, extraction, processing and distribution.'
 'In Tanzania, natural gas is found in the southern parts of the country, particularly in Mtwara, Lindi, and Ruvuma regions. Specifically, natural gas is produced at Songosongo, Mnazi Bay, Msimbati, Kiliwani North, and Ntorya. Furthermore, exploration of natural gas and petroleum is going on in Tanzania and there are signs of their availability in other coastal regions and islands of Tanzania. In recent years, the exploration has indicated the availability of petroleum and natural gas in Pemba – Zanzibar.  \nThe major producers of petroleum and natural gas in the world include USA, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Russia, Nigeria, Gabon, Libya, Kuwait, Algeria, Angola, Venezuela, Mexico, and Egypt.'

14,I want a short answer question about non-renewable resources for my students to handle.,What are non-renewable energy sources and why are they considered non-renewable?,"['Renewable and non-renewable energy: Renewable energy is energy generated from sources that are essentially inexhaustible. Examples of renewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, geothermal energy, tidal power, and hydroelectric power. Non-renewable energy includes conventional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which are likely to get depleted with use.  \nConventional and non-conventional energy: Conventional energy is an energy source which is fixed in nature like oil, gas, coal, and hydropower generation. It is also termed as non-renewable energy or thermal energy. The conventional energy resources are being used extensively; as a result, their known reserves have been depleted to a great extent. The use of conventional energy has emerging effects on the environment. The non-conventional energy involves energy generated by wind, tides, solar and biomass. These are renewable sources of energy and not exhaustible.'
 '#### Non-renewable energy sources:  \nThese refer to sources of energy that cannot be re-used. They are non-renewable because their formation takes a long time, usually millions of years. Fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas are non-renewable sources of energy. They originate from remains of plants and animals which have decomposed for a long time under high pressure and heat. These energy sources are described in the following sub-sections.'
 'Renewable energy sources: Renewable energy is any energy source that is naturally replaced. The energy can be derived from sunlight, tides, wind, water, geothermal, or hydroelectric action. Likewise, energy produced from the refining of various forms of biomass is often classified as renewable. The renewable energy sources are usually regarded as environmentally friendly because they release few chemicals that can harm the environment. These are energy resources that are naturally reused. Renewable sources are sustainable if they are carefully managed and maintained. They have minimal negative effects on the environment. Renewable energy sources include sunlight, geothermal heat, wind, tides, water, and various forms of biomass. Some of these energy sources are described in the following sub-sections.'
 '#### Mining  \nMining is a process of extracting valuable geological substances from the crust of the earth. The extracted materials may be minerals, fossil fuels, and other geological materials. However, not all geological substances are categorized as minerals. In science, a mineral has specific characteristics such as being solid, inorganic, naturally occurring, has definite chemical composition and ordered internal structure. Although oil, coal and natural gas do not possess most of these characteristics, they may be categorized as minerals. From a non-scientific view, a mineral refers to a non-living naturally occurring resource from the earth. As such, oil, coal, and natural gas also qualify to be called mineral resources. Thus, petroleum and natural gas which are discussed as case studies in this chapter are treated as minerals. Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water.'
 'Commercial and non-commercial energy: Energy sources are regarded as commercial if they are available in the market for a definite price.

In today’s interconnected world, there is no doubt about the value of integrated planning for sustainable development. There is a need to have an integrated water resources management that supports the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. Integrated Water Resources Management is one of the initiatives for sustainable use of water resources, and it refers to a process of promoting the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources, in order to maximise the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems. The management helps to protect the environment, foster economic growth and sustainable agricultural development, promote democratic participation in governance, and improve human health.'
 '### Sustainable use of water resources  \nWater resources come in many forms, but the three main categories are saltwater, groundwater, and surface water. Sustainable use of water resources includes all activities relating to current and future use of water resources in terms of protection, conservation, and management. There are surface and underground water sources.'
 'Access to water is fundamental to economic and social development. However, population growth, rapid urbanisation and industrialisation, the expansion of agriculture and tourism, and climate change all put water under increasing stress. This situation has impacted negatively the socio-economic development of most developing countries. As a result, at the global level, there is a major concern regarding the management of water resources. Water resources management emerged as a response to real and foreseen water crises and increasingly unsustainable pressure on the freshwater resources, which emanate from rising populations, growing demands for water due to competing water uses, and increasing pollution.'
 '### The concept of water management  \nWater is a colourless liquid found naturally on the land surface, atmosphere, and underground reservoirs. Water can exist in liquid, solid, or gas state. Although water is a familiar substance, it is also a unique material of the earth. For a long time, water has been considered to be an abundant resource which is found freely to all people. Today, most countries are facing increasing pressure on water resources and growing competition between differing interests. Chronic water scarcity is perceived to be one of the threats to global prosperity and stability. Other threats include hydrological uncertainty and extreme weather disasters such as floods and droughts.'

Overall, the development of the livestock-keeping sector is important in both countries. Moreover, the two countries practise livestock at both the subsistence and commercial levels. The animals and their products can be used to meet family needs and sometimes be sold to raise revenue. In Tanzania, sedentary livestock-keeping is practised in densely populated areas and, hence, with a shortage of land such as the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro and the Southern Highlands whereas in Australia it is practised specifically in the South East of the country.'
 'Livestock farming businesses provide direct employment for the Australian people. The livestock and livestock processing industries also generate about $11.2 billion in export revenue annually. In fact, the value of these exports has increased steadily over recent years generating foreign currency.'
 '#### Livestock-keeping in Australia  \nAustralia is made up of mainland Australia, the island of Tasmania and numerous isles Livestock industries have played a fundamental role in the development of Australia over the past 200 years, first as an essential source of food and later as the principal source of exports which triggered the economic growth of the nation and supported the development of its land and water resources. The livestock export industry supports the livelihood of many people in both rural and urban areas. The sector contributes to about 45% of the gross value of annual production of Australia’s agricultural sector.'
 'Livestock-keeping in Tanzania, on the contrary, is mainly for meeting domestic demands with some few animals and animal products being exported, but on a lower scale than in Australia. In Tanzania, sheep and goats are kept for meat and skins. Moreover, the application of science and technology in livestock-keeping is much more advanced in Australia than it is in Tanzania. The main rearing system of livestock-keeping in Tanzania is pastoralism and zero-grazing, whereas in Australia it is primarily the ranching system. In addition, Australia has many industries for processing animal products, whereas in Tanzania efforts are underway to establish such industries on a commercial scale.'

18,provide a true or false statement about advantages of raising livestock for students,True or False: Commercial livestock-keeping does not contribute to government revenue.,"['#### Advantages of commercial livestock-keeping:  \nCommercial livestock-keeping acts as a source of raw materials for industries such as food processing, shoe, and cloth making. It is one of the sectors which employs people and serves as a source of government revenue. Commercial livestock-keeping provides food products such as meat and milk consumed by households and industries. Moreover, it contributes to the production of goods such as shoes, bags, and animal foods. The benefits of commercial livestock-keeping include the ability to utilize breeds that can enhance reproductive performance. This practice also stimulates the development of transport and communication. Commercial livestock-keeping also facilitates the control of diseases and pests because it limits animal movement. It also uses high technology and scientific methods in management.'
 '##### Advantages of sedentary livestock-keeping:  \nThe size of the livestock makes it easy to control diseases since livestock- keepers use modern methods of treatment. Sedentary livestock-keeping also takes place in places where the population prevents the movement of animals from one place to another in search of food and water. Keeping animals in barns also enables the keepers to engage in other economic activities such as trade. Sedentary livestock-keeping can either be for food or commercial purposes.  \n##### Disadvantages of sedentary livestock-keeping:  \nDespite the advantages sedentary livestock-keeping presents, it is labour-intensive and can be time- consuming. It is also expensive in terms of building barns, feeding and taking care of the animals. In fact, livestock- keepers under the sedentary system sometimes have to deal with scarcity of animal feeds. This shortage may lower productivity particularly due to change of weather conditions such as prolonged drought.'
 '#### Benefits of livestock-keeping:  \nLivestock-keeping stimulates the growth of industries that process different animal-related products such as hides, horns, and hooves as raw materials. It is also a source of income by selling animals and their products. In addition, livestock-keeping provides employment to people, which helps to improve their living conditions. Moreover, livestock-keeping contributes to government revenue.'
 '#### Advantages of nomadic pastoralism:  \n- Generally, managing livestock using traditional methods under nomadic pastoralism is cheap. It also ensures the availability of food to the family.\n- In addition, indigenous species of cattle such as Zebu, Boran, and Ankole are resistant to diseases.\n- Furthermore, the animals can tolerate walking over long distances and withstanding other environmental hardships such as high temperatures. They can also stay for a long time without water.\n- Likewise, the cattle are cheap to manage in terms of shelter.'

 '### River basin development  \nA river basin is an area of land drained by a river and its tributaries. It has features such as tributaries, watershed and convergence. Tributaries are small rivers flowing into larger rivers whereas a watershed is an area of highland surrounding a river basin. Convergence, also known as confluence, is a place where a river joins another river. Figure 3.7 shows the sections of a river basin.  \nFigure 3.7 Sections of a river basin  \nRiver basin development is a long-term planning and management for a multipurpose project focusing on sustainable utilization of the area within the basin. River basin development may include better land use, better water use, adequate energy and food supply, transport, flood control, and protection of the environment.'
 'River basin development also attracts irrigation. Due to the availability of water in a basin, commercial agriculture is established through irrigation schemes. Sometimes, individual peasants use a well-managed river basin for watering their small farms using traditional mechanisms such as buckets. In addition, river basin development projects involve planting of trees and construction of dams. They also involve strict measures for prohibiting deforestation and poor cultivation practises. All these measures aim to foster appropriate use of the land to keep it productive. These measures also enable the preservation of the ecosystem. By doing so, these projects contribute to preventing the land from being eroded by environmental problems such as soil erosion, floods and loss of soil fertility.'
 '#### Benefits of river basin development projects  \nThe benefits of a river basin project vary depending on the nature and scale of the project, location, and administrative structure. The lower section of rivers is usually exposed to excessive rainwater, causing floods. To prevent floods, basin management establishes dams which serve as collection areas of excessive water. River basins in their natural state may hardly be safe for human settlement. In fact, the establishment of basin development projects increases the value of the basins and makes them more conducive for human settlement. This compels governments to extend social services such as infrastructure, health, and education.'

Finally, you will learn about problems related to power and energy extraction in the USA and Tanzania.'
 'HEP is primarily advantageous because it does not discharge pollutants into the environment. In addition, if people turn to using hydroelectric power, deforestation caused by use of fuelwood may be reduced. The problems faced with hydropower have to do with the aging of the dams. It is costly to maintain them for their functionality and safety. Globally, China has the biggest hydroelectric generation capacity in the world, followed by Brazil, Canada, and Russia. Currently, hydropower constitutes over 45% of the total power generated in Tanzania.  \n| Figure 8.4 | Hydro-electric power/energy             |\n| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| Figure 8.4 | A model of a hydro-electric power plant |'
 'Basin development projects involve the establishment of hydroelectric power plants following the construction of dams. The water from the dams is used to generate electricity for domestic and industrial purposes. In Tanzania, Mtera, Kidatu and Kihansi dams in Rufiji Basin are hydroelectric power stations. In addition to hydroelectric power, the constructed dams create opportunities for fishing; for example, Mtera Dam is oneofthedamswherefishingactivities take place. Moreover, well-managed basins which have gorges, waterfalls, man made reservoirs and land scenery attract tourism. Tourism is one of the potential sources of income and contributes significantly to the national economy.'
 '### Addressing challenges to power and energy harnessing in Tanzania:  \nDespite the challenges to harnessing power and energy, the following are some of the solutions to the challenges facing power and energy harnessing in Tanzania.  \nAlternative sources of power: Alternative sources of power to support the existing sources should be explored to meet the increasing power demand in Tanzania. By 2013, the annual power demand increase was between 10 percent and 15 percent.

 '#### Salt water:  \nSaltwater fish are a staple in much of the world’s diet (although overfishing and pollution has put much of the marine life population at risk). Furthermore, tidal waters are being used as a source of hydroelectric energy. So, while saltwater is not helpful in dealing with scarce water supplies, it does provide resources that humans rely on.'
 '### Economic importance of water  \nWater is a source of life for almost all living organisms including animals and plants. Numerous economic activities are conducted in water while others use water as part of raw material.  \nHuman beings are primary users of water and integrate it in their economic activities in various ways. Their ability to plan and conduct economic activities is basically supported by water. Water is used as an important ingredient in sustaining life, especially for cooking, drinking and maintaining cleanliness. Generally, water is essential for economic development. It is used in the manufacturing industry, hydro-electric power generation, and navigation as well as domestic activities and trade.'

23,Is it true that water wells can also be used for geothermal energy?,Is it true that water wells can also be used for geothermal energy?,"['Geothermal energy: Geothermal energy refers to the heat energy generated and stored in the earth. Tapping this energy involves pumping cold water into hot rock boreholes and extracting the steam through another borehole. Due to the force by which the hot water comes out, it has the ability to drive turbines to generate electricity. Geothermal power production is mostly found in volcanic areas. Geothermal evidence in Tanzania is found in Mara, Manyara, Mbeya, and Rukwa. In these areas, water naturally flows out as hot fountains. Geothermal evidence is also found in Kenya, South-Eastern Nigeria, Madagascar, USA, New Zealand, and Iceland. Figure 8.3 shows a geothermal plant generating electricity. Geothermal energy can be used for domestic purposes or on a large scale by industries. It was used during earliest times for bathing and space heating. The biggest disadvantage with geothermal energy is that it can only be produced at selected sites.'
 'Currently, solar energy is used in different parts of Tanzania. Solar thermal is used for heating and drying; and photovoltaic is used for lighting, water pumps, refrigeration purposes and telecommunication. Solar energy is used mostly in rural areas by about 64% of its people compared to urban areas with only 3.4%. The regions of Lindi, Njombe, Mtwara, Katavi, and Ruvuma lead in the use of solar power electricity in Tanzania.  \nThe advantages of using solar energy is that it is friendly to the environment. However, the technology for utilising and harnessing solar energy is expensive.  \n| Figure 8.2 Solar panels   | Figure 8.3 Geothermal Plant      |\n| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| Source: shuttersstock.com | Source: Free photoon.pixabay.com |'
 'Primary and secondary energy: Primary energy sources are those that are either found or stored in nature. This type of energy is captured directly from natural resources. Common primary energy sources are coal, oil, natural gas, and biomass (such as wood). Other primary energy sources include available nuclear energy from radioactive substances, thermal energy stored in the earth’s interior, and potential energy due to earth’s gravity. The primary energy sources are converted into secondary energy sources; for example coal, oil or gas are converted into steam and electricity. Also, heat is a primary energy, which can be transformed into secondary geothermal or solar electricity.'
 'Hydro-electric power energy: Hydro- electric power is created by the force of flowing water from mountains or high landform streams. Thus hydro-electric power is a result of water in motion. Moving water possesses energy which can be converted into electric energy if the following conditions are met:\n(i) There should be a constant supply of water. This is possible if the sources of water are areas where there is heavy rainfall, natural lake or melting water from mountain glaciers. It is also possible where there is a reservoir that could be a lake or dam to store the water needed.\n(ii) There must be a ready market for the power generated. The aim is to minimise the cost of transmitting electricity.\n(iii) The ground has to be steep to allow fast flow of water. For example, a waterfall that can drive hydro turbines.'
 '### The concept of Power and Energy  \nPower: Power is the flow of energy at any one time, and can be generated from renewable energy resources through solar conversion (solar, thermal electricity, solar heating); harnessing water (hydropower for electricity, wave and tidal generation through turbines); harnessing the wind (wind pumps for water, wind turbines for electricity); and a variety of other energy sources. The main power sources are petroleum (oil), natural gas, water, coal and nuclear. Other sources include the earth’s interior (hot springs), wind, sun, tides, and waves, wood, peat and cattle or cow dung (biogas).'

They prefer well distributed rainfall, which is ideal for flowering. In this regard, the annual rainfall should range from 1,500 mm – 2,500 mm. In addition, cloves require deep loamy soils with high humus content and well-drained black loam soils of semi-forest regions. Cloves need good drainage and prefer partial shade and a cooler climate.'
 '### Clove:  \nClove is an evergreen tree of humid tropical climate (Figure 2.8). Its flower buds are spices used in food, drinks and medicine. The clove was introduced in Zanzibar in the United Republic of Tanzania in the first half of the 19th century from Indonesia. Clove growing in Zanzibar started with plantations but it has progressively been fragmented into smaller holdings of about 3 acres. The prominent clove growing countries in the world are Indonesia, India and Madagascar. Indonesia is the biggest grower, importer and consumer of cloves.'
 '#### Uses of cloves:  \nCloves can be used in the production of oil which is used in dentistry, sanitary applications and as medicine. They also serve as a spice in food. Moreover, cloves add flavor in tea and cigarettes.

26,Can you prepare a true or false question on nomadic farming for my geography class?,True or False: Nomadic pastoralism involves continuous movement of pastoralists with large numbers of animals from place to place in search of pasture and water.,"['Nomadic pastoralism involves continual movement of pastoralists with large numbers of animals from place to place in search of pasture and water. People involved in this practice are called nomads or pastoralists. Tribes which practise nomadic pastoralism include the Maasai, Barbaig, Kwavi, and Karamajong. Nomadic pastoralism is mostly practised in sparsely populated areas where the natural vegetation is mainly grass and bushes and, sometimes, scattered trees. In these areas, rainfall is very low and unreliable. The pastoralists follow specific routes in their movements. Figure 2.10 shows a large herd of cattle. The animals kept by pastoralists are a source of food and income through the selling of animals and their products. Major products from animals are meat and milk. The pastoralists spend the money they earn to meet family needs such as buying cereals, paying school fees, and meeting health expenses. In addition, the cattle raised are used for paying bride price and giving gifts'
 '#### Characteristics of nomadic pastoralism:  \nThe nomads normally move in groups. These groups are formed through the integration of families or members of a given ethnic group. A group involves a chief or elders who make decisions for the entire group. Indeed, large herd tends to cause overgrazing. Overgrazing is a situation where the number of cattle is greater than the carrying capacity of the grazing land. As a result, overgrazing causes soil erosion, land degradation, and loss of valuable species. Another feature of the nomadic pastoralists is the breeding process, which is uncontrolled. This situation may lead to the spread and outbreak of animal diseases, hence low animal quality and deaths.  \nIn addition, there is poor control of pests and other diseases, which result to poor quality of animal products. Furthermore, nomadic pastoralism takes place where the population is scarce as the animals are grazed in open range, which needs a lot of space.'
 '#### Disadvantages of nomadic pastoralism:  \nNomadic pastoralism suffers from lack of processing and storage facilities, hence causing a significant loss of the products. Also, over-grazing under nomadic pastoralism leads to soil erosion. Moreover, the control of diseases is difficult since animals are always on the move, which can affect the health of the animals and lower productivity in the process. For example, there have been cases of loss of large numbers of livestock due to lack of water and pasture. This situation affects the economy of the pastoralists. Furthermore, the practise of nomadic pastoralism tends to cause conflicts as they interfere with crop cultivators’ land. Because of their nomadic nature, many of the pastoralists’ children fail to attend formal education. As such, their periodic movements result in many of these children being denied their right to education and associated opportunities.'
 'In addition, low capital investment limits the development of the livestock- keeping sector in the country. Also, inadequate land for grazing leads to conflicts between farmers and pastoralists. Nomadic pastoralists, for example, always move from one place to another in search of pasture and water. As a result, they sometimes graze on the farms, hence conflicts arise between them and farmers. With nomadic pastoralism, the animals get tired due to long distances over which they move. Sometimes, the animals get sick and die, thus leading to low production in terms of quality and quantity.  \n##### Ways of solving challenges facing livestock-keeping in Tanzania:'
 '#### Advantages of nomadic pastoralism:  \n- Generally, managing livestock using traditional methods under nomadic pastoralism is cheap. It also ensures the availability of food to the family.\n- In addition, indigenous species of cattle such as Zebu, Boran, and Ankole are resistant to diseases.\n- Furthermore, the animals can tolerate walking over long distances and withstanding other environmental hardships such as high temperatures. They can also stay for a long time without water.\n- Likewise, the cattle are cheap to manage in terms of shelter.'

27,"Hi, please create a short question about Tropical rainforest for me to use in class",What are some of the main trees found in a tropical monsoon forest?,"['#### Characteristics of a tropical monsoon forest  \nA monsoon forest has characteristics that distinguish it from other types of forests. Monsoon forests contain thick undergrowth of shrubs and small trees. This poses a challenge to people and animals when it comes to passing through these forests. However, the forest is more open compared to equatorial rainforests. The main trees in these forests are teak, acacia, casuarina, and bamboo. Trees in this forest are moderately tall compared to trees of other types of forests. They grow up to 30 meters high. Trees are not as close as in tropical evergreen forests. Due to this reason, the undergrowth tends to be a bit thick.'
 '#### Characteristics of an equatorial rainforest  \nAn equatorial rainforest has some characteristics that distinguish it from other types of forests. In an equatorial rainforest, the vegetation grows in layers. The upper layer forms a continuous canopy, which provides shade for lower layers. Trees grow to over 80 metres high. The second or middle layer grows up to about 30 metres high. The lower canopy grows to a range of 5 to 15 metres high. It consists of shrubs, palms and ferns with little undergrowth.  \nThe trees in this tropical rainforest are of different species, which include mahogany, rosewood, greenheart, ironwood and ebony. Most trees have large buttress roots. In addition, tropical rainforests contain climber trees.  \nNearly all the trees are broad-leaved and evergreen due to the availability of rainfall throughout the year. However, due to constant climatic conditions, plants produce flowers, fruits and shade their leaves at the same time.'
 '#### Equatorial rainforest:  \nThis type of forest is found in the equatorial region between 5˚N and 5˚S of the Equator. In this forest there are large and tall trees that grows to over 80 metres high. Figure 4.2 shows an equatorial rainforest.\nIn Tanzania, equatorial rainforests are found in coastal areas, Kagera, Kilimanjaro and Kigoma regions. Other areas in the rest of the world that have equatorial rainforests are low-lying lands of the Congo Basin in Central Africa and the coastal lands of West Africa. This type of forest is also found in the Gulf of Guinea, West of Sierra Leone, Cameroon and Gabon, Eastern Coast of Madagascar, Amazon Basin and Malaysia.  \nFigure 4.1 Distribution of the world’s natural forests'
 '#### Tropical monsoon forests:  \nTropical monsoon forests consist of deciduous trees that shed their leaves during the dry season. Figure 4.4 shows a section of a monsoon forest. These forests are located in the monsoon climate beyond the equatorial region between 10º and 25º North and South of the Equator. These forests are found in areas with seasonal rainfall, along coastal regions of Southwest India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, South Western Africa, and North-East and South-East Brazil.  \n| Figure 4.3 Mangrove forest                     | Figure 4.4 Tropical monsoon forest           |\n| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| Source: https://www.animalwised.com/endangered | Source: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tropical |'
 'The amount of water supply in a particular area also determines the type of vegetation growth. For example, due to their semi-arid climatic conditions, central parts of Tanzania such as Dodoma and Singida experience little rainfall in a year. The vegetation cover is mainly shrubs with little influence on the formation of rainfall. On the other hand, areas with equatorial climate are covered with thick vegetation (equatorial rainforests). This type of vegetation has a significant influence on rain formation due to high rates of evapotranspiration determined by high temperatures in these regions. High rainfall results in adequate water supply.'

28,Can you make me a true or false statement regarding mineral refinement methods for the students?,True or False: Crushing and grinding is a method used in mineral processing to reduce the size of ores and extract valuable minerals from the rock.,"['### Methods of mineral processing  \nMineral processing involves separating valuable minerals from other materials. There are different methods through which minerals can be processed as described below.'
 'There are two main types of mining, namely, surface and underground mining. Minerals such as salts are found close to the earth surface; as such, open cast method of mining is used to exploit them. Other minerals like gold and diamond are found deep in the ground, hence undergound mining methods are used to obtain them.  \nThe world is full of different types of minerals. Minerals can be classified into five main groups, that is, rocks used as building stones, and for brick making; non-metallic minerals such as salt, sulphur, nitrates, and asbestos; metals like gold, iron, and silver; mineral fuels including coal, petroleum and gas; and water. The whole of the earth, therefore, is full of minerals which are of great value to human beings.'
 '#### Mining  \nMining is a process of extracting valuable geological substances from the crust of the earth. The extracted materials may be minerals, fossil fuels, and other geological materials. However, not all geological substances are categorized as minerals. In science, a mineral has specific characteristics such as being solid, inorganic, naturally occurring, has definite chemical composition and ordered internal structure. Although oil, coal and natural gas do not possess most of these characteristics, they may be categorized as minerals. From a non-scientific view, a mineral refers to a non-living naturally occurring resource from the earth. As such, oil, coal, and natural gas also qualify to be called mineral resources. Thus, petroleum and natural gas which are discussed as case studies in this chapter are treated as minerals. Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water.'
 '#### Crushing and grinding:  \nCrushing and grinding intend to reduce the size of ores to extract the valuable minerals from the rock. At the low level, the ore is crushed and dissolved in water but at the advanced level water and other chemicals are mixed together to obtain the minerals. For example, in gold processing, sodium cyanide is added to the solution. The chemical dissolves the gold particles, leaving behind stones and other mineral wastes. A sodium cyanide solution containing gold particles is drained off and mixed up with zinc dust, which makes gold particles to solidify. The particles are then melted and moulded into different shapes.'
 'Surface mining is done by removing (stripping) surface vegetation, dirt, and, if necessary, layers of bedrock in order to reach buried ore deposits. Techniques of surface mining include: open-pit mining or open cast mining, which is the recovery of materials from an open pit in the ground; and quarrying, identical to open-pit mining except that it refers to sand, stone and clay. Open cast mining is the cheapest method of extracting minerals. This method is used to extract minerals which usually occur close to the earth’s surface. This method involves removing the top layers of the earth and other overlying materials above the mineral ores. Figure 5.3 shows an open cast mine. The extraction involves the use of earth moving machines and bulldozers, and electric shovels. Sometimes explosion is used to blow overlying materials in order to reach the ore beneath. This method is cheaper because the output is bigger than the costs of running. The open cast method is used to extract quarrying'

 '### Importance of the transport industry in East Africa:  \nThe transport industry is important for the socio-economic development of East African countries. The following sections explain the importance of transport in East Africa.  \n- Facilitating the availability of goods to customers: Transport makes it possible for the easy and quick movement of goods from one place to another. Thus, consumers spread in different parts of the country have the benefit of consuming goods produced at various distant places.\n- Making available raw materials to manufacturers or producers: Transport makes it possible to carry raw materials from places where they are available, to places where they can be processed and assembled into finished goods.'
 '#### Importance of oil production to Middle East countries:  \nThe Middle East is located in an arid region. Oil production has contributed to economic and social development of the Middle East countries. The countries depend greatly on the exportation of petroleum and petroleum products to earn foreign currency. Companies involved in oil production in most of the Middle East countries are mostly state-owned. However, there are also some oil fields run by private companies. These companies pay taxes to the government. The revenue from oil refining and support industries is used to provide social services such as education and health. The revenue is also used in the construction and improvement of infrastructure such as roads, railways, and airports. Jobs are also created in areas that produce oil as many people in the Middle East work in the petroleum refineries and petrochemical industries.'
 'Coal is a black or brownish-black rock made of organic substances that have been deposited for a long period. The most significant uses of coal are in electricity generation, steel production, cement manufacturing and as a liquid fuel. A number of manufacturing industries use coal to run machines. For example, in Tanzania, coal from Mbinga and Kiwira is used as a source of energy in cement production industries. In addition, the carbon present in coal is an important element when mixed with other chemicals in paper, ink and pencil-making. The carbon in coal is also an ingredient used in drugs and chemical production. For example, aspirin contains some percentages of carbon from coal. Coal is also used in the production of valuable fertilisers that are used in agriculture. Some coal products are useful in making soap, solvents and plastic fibres such as rayon and nylon used for making clothes. Other uses of coal include making construction materials, particularly when it is mixed with'

By 2013, the annual power demand increase was between 10 percent and 15 percent. The demand for power and energy is expected to increase because of the new industries that are to be constructed.  \nFunds allocation for exploration: The government is required to allocate adequate funds for exploring other sources of power. Tanzania is endowed with many power and energy sources, which have not been yet harnessed due to lack of capital.  \nTraining of skilled personnel: More young Tanzanians should be trained on HEP and biogas exploration and production.'
 '### Challenges to harnessing power and energy in Tanzania:  \nPower and energy harnessing in Tanzania faces various challenges ranging from naturally occurring to human-made ones. The following are some of the challenges facing power and energy harnessing in Tanzania.  \nFluctuation of river volume: In the dry season, rain may be scarce or completely absent which reduces water in dams and, consequently, lowers the generation of HEP. Tanzania has been experiencing periods of power-cut particularly during the dry season because of over-dependence on HEP.'
 'Inadequate capital for exploration: Exploration of sources of power and their harnessing is supposed to be a continuous activity. However, exploration demands large injection of capital, which is not readily available particularly in developing countries. Inadequate funds for the exploration of power sources and their harnessing has been a recurrent problem in Tanzania. There is generally little or no establishment of new sources of energy. As a result, there has been over-dependence on the same sources of power and energy, mainly HEP and natural gas.  \nHuman activities: Human activities such as construction and cultivation expose soil to running water. This water carries silt which is deposited in the dam causing siltation. Siltation usually reduces the capacity of dams to store water, which in turn affects production of HEP.'
 'In Tanzania, the government puts emphasis on the use of alternative energy, especially for domestic use. It also stresses the use of recycled paper charcoal instead of charcoal made from trees. In addition, there has been an increase in the use of solar power, especially where there is no power.'
 'In Tanzania the utilisation of wind energy is encouraged by factors such as the increase in the costs of oil along frequent hydro power cuts, and increased demand of power which is influenced by high population growth. Tanzania has areas of high wind potential that cover more than 10% of its land.  \nResearch works indicate that Tanzania has a lot of wind energy resources in the areas of Great Lakes, the plains, and the highland plateau regions of the Rift Valley. Also, areas such as Makambako (Njombe) and Kititimo (Singida) have sufficient wind speed for grid scale electricity generation.  \nThe advantage of using wind energy is that it does not pollute the environment. Also, it occupies a small ground space. The limitation of using wind energy is that wind turbines can disturb, or kill flying creatures like birds.  \nFigure 8.1 Windmill farm\nSource: https://www.desertsun.com/story/tech/science/energyparts'

33,Request a long-answer exercise on Post-harvest processing of tea.,Explain the post-harvest processing stages of tea in detail according to the information provided in the textbook.,"['#### Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation of tea:  \nIt takes two years for tea plants to be ready for harvesting. Picking of tea leaves requires experience because if it is done poorly, it may result in low-quality tea. Tea plants are normally plucked for 3-4 years after which all old branches are pruned for new shoots to grow. The plucked tea leaves undergo fermentation under regulated moisture to ensure quality tea product. Thereafter, tea leaves are rolled to enhance the breakup of the leaf cells and fibres. The leaves are then dried in temperatures of about 105°C. This process is called roasting or firing. Roasting stops fermentation and reduces moisture. Cool and dried tea is sorted in different sizes and graded. Unwanted particles are removed before packing. At this stage, tea is ready for consumption and export. Figure 2.6 shows the plucking of tea leaves in Iringa.  \nFigure 2.6 Tea plucking in Mufindi, Iringa  \nSource: Tea production...ratetea.com'
 '#### Harvesting, processing and transportation of sisal:  \nHarvesting of sisal begins when the colour of thorns at the tips changes from dark brown to light-brown. The processing of leaves should take place 48 hours after being harvested. Through processing, sisal fibres are obtained whereby the leaves are crushed between rollers and then mechanically scraped. Then the fibres are washed and dried. Drying of fibres is done in the sun or by using drying machines. This is followed by brushing of the dried fibres for straightening as well as polishing. Thereafter, the fibres are graded depending on their length and colour. It is important to ensure cleanliness of the bale. Graded fibres are then packed into bales either manually or by using machines.'
 '#### Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation:  \nHarvesting of coffee berries is done by hand. Only the red ripe berries are picked. Berries are dried in the sun and then are sorted, weighed and transported to the processing mills. Since coffee can easily absorb external odours which can affect its quality, it must be stored in cool, dark, and dry places to ensure freshness.'
 '#### Farm preparation, planting and caring of tea:  \nFarms for tea growing are prepared by clearing land. The ideal row spacing for tea plantation is 100 – 110 cm with the plant spacing of 65 – 75 cm. This spacing makes it possible to plant 15,000 plants in an acre.  \nTea also needs full shade and protection from other previously planted trees. The trees protect the plants from being affected by wind. In other words, they act as a wind breaker. Tea production is a labour-intensive activity because planting, weeding, picking and processing largely depend on human labour.'
 '### Tea:  \nTea is a plant whose leaves are used for making a beverage. In Tanzania, tea is mainly grown in Mbeya, Iringa, Njombe, Kagera, Kilimanjaro, and Tanga regions. Other major tea growing countries in the world are Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, China, Sri-Lanka, India, Indonesia, and Argentina.'

Such gases are sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon dioxide, methane and other hydrocarbons. The gases emitted may cause respiratory and skin diseases. Sulphur dioxide can form sulphuric acid when it comes into contact with water in the atmosphere to form acid rain. Such rain corrodes rocks, iron sheets and pollute soils, lakes and rivers. Carbon dioxide is produced due to incomplete combustion of gases, oil, coal and wood. The high concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes global warming.'
 'Oil production in the Middle East faces many challenges. With rising global demand, highly volatile prices are increasingly becoming stringent. The oil and gas industry faces three major challenges involving how to reduce costs, optimize the performance of its industrial base assets, and address its environmental footprint. Environmental pollution is one of these challenges. Oil refinery and production of petroleum products produce carbon dioxide and other gases such as methane which are harmful. As countries in the Middle East have large oil production industries, the emission of harmful gases is also high. These gases contribute to the pollution of water, air, and land. Burning fossil fuels produces sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. When they move into the atmosphere they produce acid rain, which damages buildings and vegetation in addition to affecting fish and other organisms that live in water. Another challenge facing oil production in the Middle East has to do with civil wars'
 '#### Air pollution:  \nPollution can easily be observed from oil refining industries. These manufacturing industries use heat from coal or diesel furnaces to provide steam power to run the plants. Burning this fuel can also release pollutants into the air.'
 '- Environmental pollution: Energy and power production may lead to environmental pollution. This happens when fossil fuel produces pollutants, including greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen oxide due to burning. This contributes to water and air pollution, global warming, and climate change.\n- Dam siltation: Siltation of dams constructed for HEP reduces the capacity of reservoirs. This affects the generation of hydro-electric power, and sometimes causes flooding.\n- Disposal of nuclear waste: Nuclear waste is highly radioactive. It needs to be safely disposed of or stored for many years. But the process is extremely expensive.\n- Environmental disaster: Nuclear power generation if not well-handled can be disastrous due to leakage at nuclear plants. For example, Fukushima in Japan in 2011 and Chernobyl in Russia in 1986 had nuclear leakage, which led to environmental disaster including air and land pollution, and loss of biodiversity.'

Write a detailed answer describing the temperature range, rainfall levels, and type of soil needed for successful sisal cultivation.","['#### Conditions for growing sisal:  \nSisal growing needs high temperatures ranging between 25°C and 30°C. It also needs slight rainfall ranging from 650 mm to 1,500 mm. It is grown in well-drained loamy soil. This type of soil contains a lot of decayed vegetable matter with little amounts of sand and clay. Rainfall plays an important role as far as fibre production is concerned. On the whole, sisal does not need too much rainfall and cannot tolerate frosty conditions.'
 '### Sisal  \nSisal is a tropical plant whose leaves produce strong threads (fibres) which are used for various purposes such as rope and carpet making. Sisal was originally grown in southern Mexico. Subsequently, it has been widely cultivated in many other countries. In fact, it has widely been introduced in the tropics and subtropics. In Tanzania, sisal was introduced in 1893 by Dr Richard Hindorf and the first 62 sisal plants were planted near Pangani in Tanga Region. Until the 1960s, Tanzania was the leading producer of sisal, but since then Brazil has become the major world producer of sisal, followed by Tanzania, Kenya, Madagascar and China. In Tanzania, sisal is grown in Tanga, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Morogoro, Lindi and Mtwara regions.  \nFigure 2.7 Sisal farm in Tanga  \nSource: https://www.ippmedia.com/en/news/strategising-restore-sisal-cash-crop-day'
 'Bulbils are initially grown in nurseries before being transplanted in double rows after a year. In the nursery, the bulbils should be planted in beds at 10 cm x 10 cm apart. It is recommended to use sisal waste for their growth. Thereafter, they are shifted to a second bed where they are planted at 30 cm x 30 cm apart. After 12 to 18 months, the young sisal plants are ready to be planted in the field. Unlike many other crops, sisal does not need much care. However, when it is planted on a previously used old land, it is important to use fertiliser. During the first two years it is important to control weeds by hand, machines or chemicals. Although the sisal plant is resistant to pests and diseases, it is important to control pests and diseases such as sisal weevil and bole rot. Growing sisal does not require irrigation as the sisal plant is drought-resistant and cultivated as a rain-fed crop.'
 '#### Farm preparation, planting and caring of sisal:  \nIt is recommended that land should be well-prepared by ploughing to a depth of 30 cm before planting.'
 '#### Uses of sisal:  \nSisal is used to make ropes, buffing cloth, mattresses, carpets, handicraft mats, and baskets. Sisal is commonly used in the shipping industry for mooring small craft, lashing, and handling cargo. It is also used in the automobile industry with fiber glass in composite materials. Other products developed from sisal fibre include lumbar support belts, rugs, slippers, clothes and disc buffers. Farmers also use sisal fibre for tomato plant support and ropes for reinforcement of ceiling corners. Waste from sisal extraction can be used for making biogas, pharmaceutical ingredients and building materials. Fibres can also be used as fertiliser or animal feed.'

 'Wind energy: Wind energy refers to the energy that is generated from wind. Wind mills have been used for hundreds of years to pump water from the ground. Currently, wind turbines are used to generate electricity. Wind is the second most frequently applied energy source in the world with a total installed capacity of 539.123 Gigawatt (GW) in 2017. Before harnessing wind energy, research on variables such as speed, direction, and persistency is necessary. Thereafter, wind turbines have to be set. A wind turbine operates on the following simple principles:  \n1. The power from the wind turns the windmill that has two or three propeller-like blades around a rotor.\n2. The motor is connected to a main shaft that spins a generator to generate energy. Figure 8.1 shows a windmill farm.'

This is a simple method used in collecting gold and other alluvial minerals using a pan in a river valley. It is known as panning or placer mining. It involves digging the sand and gravel from the river bed. The mineral is obtained by mixing the alluvial sand with water and swirling the pan around. Sometimes, it requires rotating the pan physically with force until the lighter particles are washed away and the heavier particles are left. Salt mining is an example of the alluvial mining method.'
 '#### Mining  \nMining is a process of extracting valuable geological substances from the crust of the earth. The extracted materials may be minerals, fossil fuels, and other geological materials. However, not all geological substances are categorized as minerals. In science, a mineral has specific characteristics such as being solid, inorganic, naturally occurring, has definite chemical composition and ordered internal structure. Although oil, coal and natural gas do not possess most of these characteristics, they may be categorized as minerals. From a non-scientific view, a mineral refers to a non-living naturally occurring resource from the earth. As such, oil, coal, and natural gas also qualify to be called mineral resources. Thus, petroleum and natural gas which are discussed as case studies in this chapter are treated as minerals.

 'Surface mining is done by removing (stripping) surface vegetation, dirt, and, if necessary, layers of bedrock in order to reach buried ore deposits. Techniques of surface mining include: open-pit mining or open cast mining, which is the recovery of materials from an open pit in the ground; and quarrying, identical to open-pit mining except that it refers to sand, stone and clay. Open cast mining is the cheapest method of extracting minerals. This method is used to extract minerals which usually occur close to the earth’s surface. This method involves removing the top layers of the earth and other overlying materials above the mineral ores. Figure 5.3 shows an open cast mine. The extraction involves the use of earth moving machines and bulldozers, and electric shovels. Sometimes explosion is used to blow overlying materials in order to reach the ore beneath.

Petroleum and natural gas are in high demand in the world because of their large contribution to power and energy generation for domestic, automobile, and industrial use.'
 'Petroleum and natural gas are used for different purposes in different sectors. Both minerals are sources of power generation. The power generated is used to run machines and engines. For example, most industrial machines, motor-vehicle engines, and generators use petroleum or gas to operate. Crude petroleum is a raw material for producing various products such as kerosene, diesel, petrol, oil and bitumen. Some by-products of petroleum are useful in chemical industries for manufacturing several products such as jelly, synthetic fibres, grease and other lubricants. In addition, petroleum wastes from refineries are used for road surfacing and wood treatment against damage and attack by insects. Natural gas is used for domestic purposes such as heating and cooking. For example, in recent years, Tanzanians have been good users of natural gas for cooking using gas stoves and gas cookers.  \n##### Other important minerals:'

The petroleum and natural gas are used for various purposes including heating homes, fueling cars, powering factories, and serving as raw materials for plastics, chemicals, medicines, fertilizers, and synthetic fibers.'
 'Natural gas energy: Natural gas is often found together with petroleum. It is found concentrated in the uppermost part of the trap. Sometimes, natural gas occurrence is independent of petroleum. Natural gas is mainly composed of hydrogen, carbons and methane. Other ingredients of natural gas include butane, propane, ethane, helium, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide. Natural gas is extracted by drilling a borehole in the ground before inserting steel tubes into the borehole. Once the drill has reached the gas-bearing rock layer, gas flows out through the borehole and keeps flowing through special pipes up to the power generating plant where the refining takes place. Figure 8.6 is an example of a natural gas plant.  \nFigure 8.6 Natural gas plant at Kinyerezi 1, Dar es Salaam\nSource: http://csi.energy/project/kinyerezi-1-power-plant-Tourist attraction:Places with energy 150-mw/'
 '#### Mining  \nMining is a process of extracting valuable geological substances from the crust of the earth. The extracted materials may be minerals, fossil fuels, and other geological materials. However, not all geological substances are categorized as minerals. In science, a mineral has specific characteristics such as being solid, inorganic, naturally occurring, has definite chemical composition and ordered internal structure. Although oil, coal and natural gas do not possess most of these characteristics, they may be categorized as minerals. From a non-scientific view, a mineral refers to a non-living naturally occurring resource from the earth. As such, oil, coal, and natural gas also qualify to be called mineral resources. Thus, petroleum and natural gas which are discussed as case studies in this chapter are treated as minerals. Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water.'

41,"good afternoon, can you help me with a explaining question about the disadvantages of nomadic pastoralism for my form 2 class?",Explain three disadvantages of nomadic pastoralism as discussed in the textbook.,"['#### Disadvantages of nomadic pastoralism:  \nNomadic pastoralism suffers from lack of processing and storage facilities, hence causing a significant loss of the products. Also, over-grazing under nomadic pastoralism leads to soil erosion. Moreover, the control of diseases is difficult since animals are always on the move, which can affect the health of the animals and lower productivity in the process. For example, there have been cases of loss of large numbers of livestock due to lack of water and pasture. This situation affects the economy of the pastoralists. Furthermore, the practise of nomadic pastoralism tends to cause conflicts as they interfere with crop cultivators’ land. Because of their nomadic nature, many of the pastoralists’ children fail to attend formal education. As such, their periodic movements result in many of these children being denied their right to education and associated opportunities.'
 '#### Advantages of nomadic pastoralism:  \n- Generally, managing livestock using traditional methods under nomadic pastoralism is cheap. It also ensures the availability of food to the family.\n- In addition, indigenous species of cattle such as Zebu, Boran, and Ankole are resistant to diseases.\n- Furthermore, the animals can tolerate walking over long distances and withstanding other environmental hardships such as high temperatures. They can also stay for a long time without water.\n- Likewise, the cattle are cheap to manage in terms of shelter.'
 '#### Characteristics of nomadic pastoralism:  \nThe nomads normally move in groups. These groups are formed through the integration of families or members of a given ethnic group. A group involves a chief or elders who make decisions for the entire group. Indeed, large herd tends to cause overgrazing. Overgrazing is a situation where the number of cattle is greater than the carrying capacity of the grazing land. As a result, overgrazing causes soil erosion, land degradation, and loss of valuable species. Another feature of the nomadic pastoralists is the breeding process, which is uncontrolled. This situation may lead to the spread and outbreak of animal diseases, hence low animal quality and deaths.  \nIn addition, there is poor control of pests and other diseases, which result to poor quality of animal products. Furthermore, nomadic pastoralism takes place where the population is scarce as the animals are grazed in open range, which needs a lot of space.'
 'Nomadic pastoralism involves continual movement of pastoralists with large numbers of animals from place to place in search of pasture and water. People involved in this practice are called nomads or pastoralists. Tribes which practise nomadic pastoralism include the Maasai, Barbaig, Kwavi, and Karamajong. Nomadic pastoralism is mostly practised in sparsely populated areas where the natural vegetation is mainly grass and bushes and, sometimes, scattered trees. In these areas, rainfall is very low and unreliable. The pastoralists follow specific routes in their movements. Figure 2.10 shows a large herd of cattle. The animals kept by pastoralists are a source of food and income through the selling of animals and their products. Major products from animals are meat and milk. The pastoralists spend the money they earn to meet family needs such as buying cereals, paying school fees, and meeting health expenses. In addition, the cattle raised are used for paying bride price and giving gifts'
 'In addition, low capital investment limits the development of the livestock- keeping sector in the country. Also, inadequate land for grazing leads to conflicts between farmers and pastoralists. Nomadic pastoralists, for example, always move from one place to another in search of pasture and water. As a result, they sometimes graze on the farms, hence conflicts arise between them and farmers. With nomadic pastoralism, the animals get tired due to long distances over which they move. Sometimes, the animals get sick and die, thus leading to low production in terms of quality and quantity.  \n##### Ways of solving challenges facing livestock-keeping in Tanzania:'

The coffee seedlings are raised on seed-beds and transplanted after six months, with three meters spacing. The coffee trees are pruned annually to ensure maximum yield. Pruning is also done to facilitate the picking of coffee beans. Weeds such as star-grass and couch grass are removed to increase yield. Pruning is also done to facilitate the picking of coffee beans. Weeds such as star-grass and couch grass are removed to increase yields. In addition, spraying of coffee plants is done in cases of least rusting and Coffee Berry Diseases (CBD). Fertilisers such as nitrogen, phosphates, potassium and magnesium are applied in places where soil fertility is low.'
 'vi. Providing a lively habitat, which is able to harbor different bird species. The birds help to facilitate pollination and serve as a biological insect control. Due to increasing demand of coffee, a scientific way of productivity which involve growing coffee plants in the open sun, was developed for coffee farming. This approach is accompanied with the continued application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides which, among other things, make up for the loss of nutrients.  \n##### Topography  \nGenerally, coffee is grown on slopes having a height between 600 to 1,800 meters. Water stagnation is very harmful for coffee plants; therefore, hill slopes are best suitable for growing coffee.  \n##### Soils  \nSoil is the guiding factor in coffee plantation. Coffee plantation requires deep well drained soils which are rich in humus, minerals nutrients and of good texture to allow free air circulation.'
 '#### Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation:  \nHarvesting of coffee berries is done by hand. Only the red ripe berries are picked. Berries are dried in the sun and then are sorted, weighed and transported to the processing mills. Since coffee can easily absorb external odours which can affect its quality, it must be stored in cool, dark, and dry places to ensure freshness.'
 '### Coffee:  \nCoffee is a crop which produces coffee beans that are processed to make a beverage (Figure 2.1). It forms an important cash crop for export. In Tanzania, coffee is grown in Kagera, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Mbeya, Katavi, Iringa, Mara, Njombe, tanga, Morogoro, Kigoma, and Ruvuma regions (Figure 2.2). Coffee is also grown in Kenya, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, Rwanda and Ethiopia. Other countries include Cameroon, Brazil, Columbia, Indonesia, Honduras, India, Vietnam, The Philippines and Mexico.

The word 'livestock' applies primarily to cattle or dairy cows, goats, pigs, camels, horses, mules, poultry and sheep. Poultry includes ducks, chicken, turkey, and geese. The population growth and ever increasing demand for food supply lead to the growth of livestock-keeping. Livestock-keeping contributes to the economic development of a country since it is a source of food as well as raw materials for industries. It is also a source of income as well as employment opportunities. Besides, it is a source of foreign currency.""
 'In Tanzania and Australia livestock-keeping is important because it stimulates other sectors of the economy, for example, the development of transport and communication networks and processing industries such as leather and milk. Moreover, livestock-keeping promotes trade through selling animals and animal products within and outside these two countries. It also promotes employment to different people who work in processing industries. Livestock-keeping provides skins, hides, cheese, butter, milk, and meat. These products are sold and enable individual households and the nation to earn money. Furthermore, the sector generates revenue to these countries through tax collection from the industries operating in this livestock sector. It also encourages the use of marginal lands. Livestock-keeping, especially ranching and pastoralism, which need large open areas, make use of land which is otherwise not suitable for other uses. Farmers also apply cattle manure to add nutrients to the soil'
 '### Focal studies  \n#### Livestock-keeping in Tanzania  \nLivestock production is one of the major agricultural activities in Tanzania. It contributes to the availability of food and raw materials. The sector also contributes to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Monsoon forests contain thick undergrowth of shrubs and small trees. This poses a challenge to people and animals when it comes to passing through these forests. However, the forest is more open compared to equatorial rainforests. The main trees in these forests are teak, acacia, casuarina, and bamboo. Trees in this forest are moderately tall compared to trees of other types of forests. They grow up to 30 meters high. Trees are not as close as in tropical evergreen forests. Due to this reason, the undergrowth tends to be a bit thick.'

The second or middle layer grows up to about 30 metres high. The lower canopy grows to a range of 5 to 15 metres high. It consists of shrubs, palms and ferns with little undergrowth.  \nThe trees in this tropical rainforest are of different species, which include mahogany, rosewood, greenheart, ironwood and ebony. Most trees have large buttress roots. In addition, tropical rainforests contain climber trees.  \nNearly all the trees are broad-leaved and evergreen due to the availability of rainfall throughout the year.

Figure 4.2 shows an equatorial rainforest.\nIn Tanzania, equatorial rainforests are found in coastal areas, Kagera, Kilimanjaro and Kigoma regions. Other areas in the rest of the world that have equatorial rainforests are low-lying lands of the Congo Basin in Central Africa and the coastal lands of West Africa. This type of forest is also found in the Gulf of Guinea, West of Sierra Leone, Cameroon and Gabon, Eastern Coast of Madagascar, Amazon Basin and Malaysia.  \nFigure 4.1 Distribution of the world’s natural forests'
 'Rainfall: The distribution of forests is also influenced by rainfall. Forests thrive well in areas with plenty of rainfall of over 1200 mm throughout the year. The dense equatorial forests have thrived well because of the presence of heavy rainfall that is well distributed throughout the year. In deciduous forest regions, trees that can survive the dry season exist. These trees shed their leaves during the dry season to reduce water loss through transpiration as their means of survival. Relief is another factor that influences the distribution of forests. It determines soil, temperature and vegetation distribution across gradient. Tree distribution varies with altitude. For example, on Mount Kilimanjaro at 1800-3000 m above sea level, forests consist of diverse tree species. At higher altitude (3000 m), alpine heath dominate. Thus, differences in relief are associated with variations in the type of forests.'

0,Could you pls create a short answer question about evaporation for my class?,What factors influence the rate of evaporation according to the context provided in the textbook?,"['### Evaporation  \nEvaporation is the process by which water changes from liquid to gas or vapour. During evaporation, water moves into the atmosphere in the form of water vapour or moisture. Water bodies such as rivers, lakes, seas, and oceans contribute about 90% of the moisture found in the atmosphere through evaporation. Water changes into vapour under the great influence of temperature. Areas with high temperatures and low humidity experience a high rate of evaporation. Evaporation is also determined by humidity and wind.'
 '### Evapotranspiration  \nEvapotranspiration refers to the process whereby water is transferred from the land to the air through plant roots and leaves. Water from the land is carried by roots to the leaves, a process known as transpiration, and then from the leaves it changes into vapour and moves into the atmosphere through the process of evaporation. The combination of these two processes form what is termed as evapotranspiration (Evaporation + transpiration = evapotranspiration). Evapotranspiration is determined by factors such as temperature, humidity, wind, soil, and type of plants. These factors are hereby explained.'
 '#### Temperature:  \nAn increase in temperature accelerates the rate of evaporation. During the warm season, plants open their stomata (pores) and release water in the form of water vapour. During the cold season, plants close their stomata and prohibit the release of water. 10% of the moisture in the atmosphere is contributed by the release of water from plants.  \nFigure 3.2: Evaporation from ocean water  \nFigure 3.3: Evapotranspiration'
 '#### Infiltration:  \nInfiltration, which is sometimes called percolation, is the process whereby water that has reached the ground penetrates into the soil or rocks (Figure 3.6).  \nSome of the water may seep through and go deep underground and create underground runoff or aquifer in the rocks. Water that percolates the land surface is called underground water. Infiltration is an essential process as it feeds water bodies and soils which are sources of evaporation and evapotranspiration.'
 '### Fresh water and hydrological cycle  \nThe hydrological cycle is a continuous circulation of water from the earth’s surface to the atmosphere through the process of evaporation, evapotranspiration, condensation, precipitation and infiltration.

The word 'livestock' applies primarily to cattle or dairy cows, goats, pigs, camels, horses, mules, poultry, and sheep. The word 'livestock' applies primarily to cattle or dairy cows, goats, pigs, camels, horses, mules, poultry and sheep. Poultry includes ducks, chicken, turkey, and geese. The population growth and ever increasing demand for food supply lead to the growth of livestock-keeping. Livestock-keeping contributes to the economic development of a country since it is a source of food as well as raw materials for industries. It is also a source of income as well as employment opportunities. Besides, it is a source of foreign currency.""
 '#### Benefits of livestock-keeping:  \nLivestock-keeping stimulates the growth of industries that process different animal-related products such as hides, horns, and hooves as raw materials. It is also a source of income by selling animals and their products. In addition, livestock-keeping provides employment to people, which helps to improve their living conditions. Moreover, livestock-keeping contributes to government revenue.'
 'health expenses. In addition, the cattle raised are used for paying bride price and giving gifts as well as slaughtering during cultural festivals. To the nomads, animals are a symbol of wealth and prestige.'
 'In Tanzania and Australia livestock-keeping is important because it stimulates other sectors of the economy, for example, the development of transport and communication networks and processing industries such as leather and milk. Moreover, livestock-keeping promotes trade through selling animals and animal products within and outside these two countries. It also promotes employment to different people who work in processing industries. Livestock-keeping provides skins, hides, cheese, butter, milk, and meat. These products are sold and enable individual households and the nation to earn money. Furthermore, the sector generates revenue to these countries through tax collection from the industries operating in this livestock sector. It also encourages the use of marginal lands. Livestock-keeping, especially ranching and pastoralism, which need large open areas, make use of land which is otherwise not suitable for other uses. Farmers also apply cattle manure to add nutrients to the soil'
 '### Commercial livestock-keeping  \nCommercial livestock-keeping involves rearing of animals for the purpose of selling their products such as meat, milk, wool and hides. Ranching, as part of commercial livestock-keeping, is mostly practised in more remote areas where land is extensive and population density is low. Extensive land provides sufficient grass to support a large number of animals. Commercial livestock-keeping is determined by factors such as capital, level of technology, market, availability of pasture and climatic conditions. In temperate regions, supplementary food such as hay and root crops are used to feed them during winter. Animals are kept for meat (beef cattle), for milk (dairy cattle and camel) and for wool (sheep).'

Later they are transported to river banks where they are loaded into pontoons and ferries. In the dense network of streams and major rivers in the Amazon and Congo basins, waterways have not sufficiently been utilised to transport logs. This leads to frequent stoppage of logs at difficult spots. In addition, the weight of huge logs make floating in rivers difficult. Rapids and falls interrupt these rivers, making floating of logs impossible. The scattered distribution of the most valuable trees complicates even further the river transportation of logs.'
 'The countries that depend on floating logs in water as the main means of transport, face challenges to transport heavy logs. Timber transportation may also pose a challenge especially when forests are located in remote areas away from market centers. In fact, this situation increases the transportation cost for harvested forest resources. For example, in the equatorial rainforest, forests are dense and located in hardly accessible areas and, therefore, making it difficult to transport logs to the processing areas. Seasonal variation of water in rivers is also a challenge for timber transportation. Water in rivers fluctuate seasonally. During the dry season, the volume of water decreases whereas during the rainy season the volume increases. In this case, the reduction in the volume of water in the rivers hinders the transportation of logs to the processing industries.

Skilled labour is required in the textile industry for designing, spinning, cotton weaving, bleaching, dyeing, and printing of cotton fabrics. Unskilled labour is equally needed to support skilled workers, for example, by clearing and providing security.  \nThe textile industry also stimulates production in other sectors of the economy such as agriculture, transportation, commerce, and trade. The industry operates because raw materials are readily available. In Tanzania, cotton is the main raw material for the textile industry. Farmers will continue to produce cotton when they are assured of ready markets for their cotton.'
 '### Textile industries in Tanzania  \nTextile industries deal with the manufacturing of clothes from cotton, wool, silk, nylon, rayon or linen as raw materials.

 '#### Challenges facing textile industries in Tanzania:  \nMany of the textile industries have been operating for a long time in such a way that their machines have become out of date. With the advancement of technology, the old machines in textile industries need to be replaced by new ones for efficiency purposes. There is also a lack of adequate skilled labour, leading to the need to import labour from outside the country, resulting in increased production costs. Lack of adequate capital and inadequate supply of raw materials limit the ability of the industries to increase productivity.  \nPoor transport and communication systems also hinder timely transportation of raw materials to industries and manufactured goods to the markets. High costs and unreliable power supply constitute other challenges because they reduce profit from industrial production. The chemicals used in textile industries are also expensive, leading to reduced profit from textile industries.'

They produce goods which can be used as raw materials for other industries or can be directly consumed. These industries are also concerned with the processing of bulk raw materials into other products. Some of these are described below.  \n(a) Textile processing industries:These industries deal with spinning and weaving of textile materials from cotton, wool and silk. Artificial fibres such as rayon, nylon and dacron are used in textile industries. Textile industries in Tanzania include Musoma Textile (MUTEX), Mwanza Textile (MWATEX), Karibu Textile Mills (KTM) and Morogoro Polytex.'
 'Another important contribution is the development of transport infrastructure such as roads and railways. Good transport enables cotton to reach the factory and products to reach the market at a minimum cost and in time. Textile industries are also sources of foreign currency. The development of the textile industry depends on the availability of both internal and international markets. Since there is no country that can meet the demands of its people by only using locally produced goods, there is a need to produce more for export to get foreign currency. Textile industries also promote international relations through trade. There is so much trading in the world because of differences in resource endowment and climate. For example, there are countries producing cars (Japan) while others produce textile materials (Tanzania). This distribution of manufactures justifies the need for trading of the products among nations, which also helps build healthy and good relations.'

10,I need a defining question about soil absorption for my form 2 geography class,What is the role of trees in soil affected by erosion in terms of absorption and water management?,"['(b) Reclamation of land affected by soil erosion differs from land covered by water. Soil affected by erosion calls for planting of trees. Trees will act as binding agents for keeping the soil particles together and absorbing excess water which would otherwise flow rapidly over the land. Moreover, using better methods of agriculture such as contour ploughing, terracing, and strip farming especially in steep slopes helps to prevent erosion.  \n(c) Land may also be reclaimed by restoring its fertility. In this case, land which has lost fertility may require planting cover crops and addition of organic manure and fertilisers to improve its fertility. The fertility will attract vegetation growth. Vegetation will not only bind the soil but also protect it from excessive loss of water through transpiration.  \n(d) Land affected by excessive animal keeping can be restored by reducing the number of animals in the area. This simple reclamation method allows the land to be proportionally used.'
 '#### Soil:  \nThe type of soil also determines the amount of water that can be retained in the soil and the amount of water that can be drawn from the soil through transpiration or evaporation. Fertile soil tends to support the growth of vegetation which increases the rate of evapotranspiration. Soil, which supports vegetation, allows much evapotranspiration to take place.'
 '#### Infiltration:  \nInfiltration, which is sometimes called percolation, is the process whereby water that has reached the ground penetrates into the soil or rocks (Figure 3.6).  \nSome of the water may seep through and go deep underground and create underground runoff or aquifer in the rocks. Water that percolates the land surface is called underground water. Infiltration is an essential process as it feeds water bodies and soils which are sources of evaporation and evapotranspiration.'
 'During photosynthesis, oxygen is released by plants into the environment through the stomata, and this is used by animals. At the same time animals release carbon dioxide that is absorbed by the plants. By doing so, a balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide in the environment is maintained. Forests provide suitable habitats for wildlife and, therefore, contribute to the balance of ecosystem. Various animals live in the forest which gives them shelter and food as they eat leaves, roots and fruits. Moreover, forests help to control soil erosion as they protect the soil from being eroded by blowing wind and running water. Trees in the forest bind together the soil particles using roots, and reduce the impact of raindrops with the same roots. Plant leaves reduce the impact of rain drops on the soil and reduce excessive evaporation of soil water.'
 '### Evapotranspiration  \nEvapotranspiration refers to the process whereby water is transferred from the land to the air through plant roots and leaves. Water from the land is carried by roots to the leaves, a process known as transpiration, and then from the leaves it changes into vapour and moves into the atmosphere through the process of evaporation. The combination of these two processes form what is termed as evapotranspiration (Evaporation + transpiration = evapotranspiration). Evapotranspiration is determined by factors such as temperature, humidity, wind, soil, and type of plants. These factors are hereby explained.'
 'Transpiration is...\n(a) soil infiltration.\n(b) water turning directly from ice to water vapour.\n(c) evaporation from the leaves of trees.\n(d) runoff from steep hills.'

The major reclamation projects have been carried out by the government through its agencies and international agencies. In particular, major reclamation projects have been carried out in Dodoma and Shinyanga regions. They are soil conservation programmes better known by their Kiswahili acronyms as HADO (Hifadhi Ardhi Dodoma) and HASHI (Hifadhi Ardhi Shinyanga).'
 'The HADO project was a large project implemented by the Government of Tanzania in 1973-1997, and was funded by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA). The main objective of the project was to conserve land and water, and rehabilitate the already depleted areas, particularly the severely affected Irangi Hills. The project strategies focused on promoting tree planting, bee-keeping, soil and water conservation, reclaiming degraded land, and local participation in conservation matters. The method of land reclamation involved the construction of terraces and cutting off drainage to check the speed of runoff water. However, the construction was not successful as grazing animals and uncontrolled runoff destroyed the barriers. HADO also involved uncontrolled livestock-keeping. As a result, huge gullies developed.'
 '### Addressing challenges facing forest resources  \nAlthough forests continually face a number of challenges across the world, countries have been making concerted efforts to find lasting solutions to these challenges. Simply put, deforested area should be reforested. Reforestation is the establishment of a forest through planting trees in an area where plant cover was destroyed through careless felling of trees. A reforestation programme that has been implemented in Tanzania is the Management of Natural Resources Programme funded by the Governments of Norway and Tanzania. The programme was implemented by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism (MNRT) between July 2002-June 2006. The objective of the programme was to increase benefits to rural communities based on sustainable natural resource management in Tanzania. The outcomes of the programme were to:'
 'When land is reclaimed, it is termed as reclamation ground. Land reclamation aims to increase areas for agriculture and settlement. The reclamation also aims to obtain land for industries and places for recreation. Further, the focus is also on improving transport systems on the land and waterways as well as controlling floods that might take place in an area. Nevertheless, land reclamation processes are expensive and may damage corals and marine life if not handled with great care. The reclaimed lands can also be vulnerable to natural hazards such as earthquakes because they are in most cases not as strong as naturally situated lands. In fact, the reclaimed land can easily sink when there is an earthquake. Erosion may also be severe in the reclaimed land because of the nature of the soil. Soil in the reclaimed land is not as compact as in the naturally situated land.'
 '#### Planted forests:  \nPlanted forests refer to a collection of trees by human beings. These forests cover relatively large areas of land. Figure 4.7 shows part of a planted forest at Sao Hill in Iringa. Trees in these forests are of specific value such as commercial or land conservation. Planted forests are usually grown on a large-scale or small-scale basis. In many cases governments and companies or groups of people establish large-scale forests while small groups of people or individuals establish small-scale forests. In Tanzania, notable planted forests are in Iringa, Kagera, Kigoma, Kilimanjaro, and Arusha regions. Trees are established through seeding and planting of either native or exotic species. These forests are properly managed from planting to harvesting time to ensure high productivity.'

Similarly, deforestation is a challenge to the forests. It exposes the soil, which was once protected by the forest cover, hence making it vulnerable to the agents of soil erosion such as wind, rainfall and water runoff. The resultant erosion affects the quality of the soil which loses its fertility, and limits the growth of trees.'
 '### The concept of forest  \nA forest is an extensive area of land mostly covered by trees of different sizes, species and other forms of undergrowth. By 2015, it was estimated that forests covered about 31% of the earth’s surface. Forest distribution on the earth’s surface varies. Such variation is caused by the amount of rainfall available and the length of wet and warm seasons per year. Forests can be absent in some areas even where the climatic conditions allow tree growth. Absence of forests in extensive areas can be caused by actions of human beings and wild animals.'
 '##### Forestry:  \nForestry is a set of practices that involve managing forests for ecological, social, and economic purposes. There are two types of forests: natural and man-made (planted) forests.  \n##### Planted forests:  \nPlanted forests are those in which trees are planted by human beings. They are commonly known as grown trees. The trees may be obtained locally or from other countries. In Tanzania, mahogany and teak are examples of local species whereas pines and eucalyptus are species from other countries. Some examples of planted forests in Tanzania include The Sao Hill forest plantation in Mafinga, Iringa Region and The West Kilimanjaro forest plantation in Kilimanjaro Region.'
 'Human beings obtain various products and services from forests. Forest products can be timber and non-timber products that help to sustain human life. Non-timber forest products include fruits, honey, leaves, roots and barks. The process of managing forest resources for human use is known as forestry. Foresters engage in lumbering, which is an activity that involves cutting, transporting, processing and selling timber. The terms ‘timber’ and ‘log’ are used interchangeably to mean branches or pieces of the trunk of a tree, but with the bark attached. Harvesting of forest resources is generally sustainable when there is no or little damage to the general environment. A forest can be natural or planted. Animals, birds and insects use forests to support their lives. Forests provide aesthetic value and services to human beings.'
 'Planted forests are regularly cleaned by removing unwanted undergrowth, which may hinder the healthy growth of the planted species. Foresters provide close and strict supervision from planting to harvesting because of the commercial value of the trees. For example, planted trees in Sao Hill are for electrical polls, paper-making and timber production. Timber is sold locally or exported.'

15,I need a describe question for my students on the topic of benefits of subsistence farming in Tanzania,Describe the benefits of subsistence farming in Tanzania according to the textbook information provided.,"['Some of the challenges facing large-scale crop cultivation in Tanzania are high cost of production. Large-scale farming requires a large capital investment to buy machinery and farm inputs, prepare land and pay farm labourers. It also relies on seasonal rainfall. Climatic changes have largely affected the amount of rainfall in many areas of Tanzania. Since the majority of large-scale farmers in Tanzania rely on rain-fed agriculture, whenever there is a shortage of rainfall, agricultural production falls. Agricultural products from large-scale crop cultivation in Tanzania such as tea, sisal and coffee face stiff competition from other countries that produce the same crops. As a result, prices of such products tend to be low. In addition, large-scale crop cultivation in Tanzania has to contend with pests and diseases. Pests such as army worms and quelea quelea tend to destroy crops faster than measures aimed to control them can cope. Inadequate management of pest invasion leads to heavy'
 'In both countries, dairy farming is practised where there is adequate water supply and plenty of pasture. Overall, the development of the livestock-keeping sector is important in both countries. Moreover, the two countries practise livestock at both the subsistence and commercial levels. The animals and their products can be used to meet family needs and sometimes be sold to raise revenue. In Tanzania, sedentary livestock-keeping is practised in densely populated areas and, hence, with a shortage of land such as the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro and the Southern Highlands whereas in Australia it is practised specifically in the South East of the country.'

Finally, you will learn about the various types of livestock keeping practices as well as their benefits and constraints by focusing on Tanzania and Australia.'
 '#### Small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop cultivation is the growing of crops on a small piece of land. It is also called subsistence farming. It aims to produce enough food for the wellbeing of families. In some instances, when the production is high, the surplus is sold. Individuals engaging in small-scale crop cultivation are known as peasants. They are also called subsistence farmers as they grow food crops to feed themselves and their families with little or no surplus for sale.  \nAs noted earlier, the agricultural system at subsistence level falls under this category. A farmer owns a small piece of land for food crops cultivation. The produce is enough only for the family. It is hand to mouth existence which may lead to famine if the harvest is bad. In years with good harvest the farmer may have surplus to sell to the local markets. The farms are small, about one to five hectares owned by the family. Application of machines is difficult as farms are small.'
 '### Focal studies  \n#### Livestock-keeping in Tanzania  \nLivestock production is one of the major agricultural activities in Tanzania. It contributes to the availability of food and raw materials. The sector also contributes to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The National Ranching Company (NARCO) is responsible for managing all public ranches in the country. Most of the livestock products are for the domestic market. This sub-sector needs to be developed particularly in dairy farming and its products and meat processing to meet the domestic demands and for export.

16,"good afternoon, i need explaining question for my students about procedures for cotton farming ",Explain the procedures involved in preparing cotton farms for planting according to the textbook excerpt provided.,"['#### Farm preparation, planting and care of cotton:  \nCotton farms are prepared before the rainy season. The planting of cotton seeds takes place during the rainy season. Cotton flowering occurs between two and three months after planting. To maintain healthy cotton plants, there is a need for regular spraying of cotton plants with pesticides. This measure is necessary because a number of pests and diseases attack cotton plants. The common pests which usually attack cotton plants include cotton aphids, stink bugs, and boll weevils. In addition, diseases such as cotton leaf curl, cotton blue, and root rot attack cotton plants.'
 '#### Conditions necessary for growing cotton:  \nCotton grows in warm temperatures of about 25°C. It requires moderate rainfall of about 550 mm to 1,000 mm. However, in areas with less rainfall cotton can grow under irrigation. For example, the Gezira Irrigation Scheme in Sudan supports cotton growth. It also requires well-drained fertile soil. Moreover, cotton requires at least 200 frost-free days as the crop is sensitive to frost.'
 '### Cotton  \nCotton is a flowering plant which is grown for making cotton fabric and threads. It is a soft and fluffy fiber that grows in a boll or protective case around the seeds of a cotton plant.The plant is native to tropical and sub-tropical regions in the world including Africa and the Americas. The major cotton producers are China, USA, India, Pakistan, Brazil, Egypt, Benin, Mali, Cameroon, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Australia, Turkey, Sudan, and Russia. In Tanzania, cotton is mainly grown in Mwanza, Tabora, Mara, Shinyanga, Geita, and Simiyu regions.

For example, there is a luxury train that runs between Swakopmund and Windhoek. Also, Air Namibia offers several scheduled domestic flights to enhance tourist movements. The private sector is also working closely with the government to improve accommodation facilities.'
 '- Financial resources: Despite the efforts made by the government to allocate funds for transport development, the amount is far below what is actually required to finance and maintain the existing transport network. Thus, there is a need to engage the private sector in infrastructure development. The involvement of the private sector in infrastructural development and operations can help ease public resource constraints.

19,Can u prepare a detailed question on what are the benefits of developing river basins? Students need to provide comprehensive answers please.,Explain the benefits of developing river basins in detail.,"['#### Benefits of river basin development projects  \nThe benefits of a river basin project vary depending on the nature and scale of the project, location, and administrative structure. The lower section of rivers is usually exposed to excessive rainwater, causing floods. To prevent floods, basin management establishes dams which serve as collection areas of excessive water. River basins in their natural state may hardly be safe for human settlement. In fact, the establishment of basin development projects increases the value of the basins and makes them more conducive for human settlement. This compels governments to extend social services such as infrastructure, health, and education.'
 'River basin development also attracts irrigation. Due to the availability of water in a basin, commercial agriculture is established through irrigation schemes. Sometimes, individual peasants use a well-managed river basin for watering their small farms using traditional mechanisms such as buckets. In addition, river basin development projects involve planting of trees and construction of dams. They also involve strict measures for prohibiting deforestation and poor cultivation practises. All these measures aim to foster appropriate use of the land to keep it productive. These measures also enable the preservation of the ecosystem. By doing so, these projects contribute to preventing the land from being eroded by environmental problems such as soil erosion, floods and loss of soil fertility.'
 '### River basin development  \nA river basin is an area of land drained by a river and its tributaries. It has features such as tributaries, watershed and convergence. Tributaries are small rivers flowing into larger rivers whereas a watershed is an area of highland surrounding a river basin. Convergence, also known as confluence, is a place where a river joins another river. Figure 3.7 shows the sections of a river basin.  \nFigure 3.7 Sections of a river basin  \nRiver basin development is a long-term planning and management for a multipurpose project focusing on sustainable utilization of the area within the basin. River basin development may include better land use, better water use, adequate energy and food supply, transport, flood control, and protection of the environment.'
 '#### Requirements for establishing a river basin project  \nAs river basin projects serve social and economic purposes, they need to be carefully designed by observing a number of issues. The following are some of the requirements which should be observed when establishing a river basin project:  \n- Construction of dams for retaining water.\n- Removal of silt or mud from the river or dam (dredging).\n- For transport purposes, the river channels should be straightened and widened so that they can accommodate more water.\n- Trees should be planted on marginal land, hill slopes, and riverbanks. This will help to control soil erosion and check the movement of surface run-off, to reduce or prevent silting and flooding.  \nIf such requirements are observed, river basin projects will achieve the expected benefits.'

20,Give me a short question on land restoration in Tanzania for my classwork.,What were the main objectives of the HADO project in Tanzania?,"['#### Land reclamation in Tanzania  \nThere have been various projects and efforts for land reclamation in Tanzania. The major reclamation projects have been carried out by the government through its agencies and international agencies. In particular, major reclamation projects have been carried out in Dodoma and Shinyanga regions. They are soil conservation programmes better known by their Kiswahili acronyms as HADO (Hifadhi Ardhi Dodoma) and HASHI (Hifadhi Ardhi Shinyanga).'
 'The HADO project was a large project implemented by the Government of Tanzania in 1973-1997, and was funded by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA). The main objective of the project was to conserve land and water, and rehabilitate the already depleted areas, particularly the severely affected Irangi Hills. The project strategies focused on promoting tree planting, bee-keeping, soil and water conservation, reclaiming degraded land, and local participation in conservation matters. The method of land reclamation involved the construction of terraces and cutting off drainage to check the speed of runoff water. However, the construction was not successful as grazing animals and uncontrolled runoff destroyed the barriers. HADO also involved uncontrolled livestock-keeping. As a result, huge gullies developed.'
 'Improvement of infrastructure: In making energy more accessible to all, infrastructure should be improved. Inland roads in remote areas should be rehabilitated to easen transportation of poles for the supply of electricity. Pipeline networks for natural gas distribution should also be built in various parts of the country for electricity generation.  \nCommunity awareness creation: The society should be educated on the need to conserve the environment by using environmentally-friendly sources of power.  \nEnvironmental conservation campaign: Various campaigns towards environmental conservation have been launched in Tanzania. Examples include the Mama Misitu campaign which was launched in Tanzania. This five-year (2011 - 2016) campaign aimed to improve community based forest governance. When forests are protected there would be less erosion and, hence, less siltation.'
 '### Addressing challenges facing forest resources  \nAlthough forests continually face a number of challenges across the world, countries have been making concerted efforts to find lasting solutions to these challenges. Simply put, deforested area should be reforested. Reforestation is the establishment of a forest through planting trees in an area where plant cover was destroyed through careless felling of trees. A reforestation programme that has been implemented in Tanzania is the Management of Natural Resources Programme funded by the Governments of Norway and Tanzania. The programme was implemented by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism (MNRT) between July 2002-June 2006. The objective of the programme was to increase benefits to rural communities based on sustainable natural resource management in Tanzania. The outcomes of the programme were to:'
 '#### Management of national parks and game reserves in Tanzania:  \nNational parks in Tanzania are managed by the Tanzania National Parks Authority (TANAPA).

But some of the by-products of manufacturing waste materials left over or substances produced by the manufacturing process itself, may be harmful to the environment. Manufacturing contributes to air and water pollution for example the Wazo Hill Cement industry in Dar es Salaam.'
 '#### Air pollution:  \nPollution can easily be observed from oil refining industries. These manufacturing industries use heat from coal or diesel furnaces to provide steam power to run the plants. Burning this fuel can also release pollutants into the air.'
 '### Pollutants from manufacturing industries:  \nIndustrial pollutants are substances that make air, water and soil harmful to living organisms. The manufacturing industries produce different pollutants which are dangerous to human health and the environment. These pollutants are categorized as gas, solids, liquids and noise.'
 '### Major ways of reducing industrial pollution  \nThere are several ways of reducing pollution from industries. These ways include the following.  \n- (a) Locating industries away from residential areas. There should be a proper policy on locating industries.\n- (b) Laws and by-laws should be enacted to protect the environment against pollution.\n- (c) Encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy which are environmental friendly, for example, the use of solar energy and hydro-electric power.\n- (d) Complete combustion of fuels in industrial machines should be ensured as it reduces air pollution.\n- (e) Liquid waste from industries should be treated before it is discharged as waste, to reduce the effects on the environment.\n- (f) Industrial waste can be reduced through re-use and recycling of plastic materials, bottles and cans to produce other materials.\n- (g) Routine inspection and maintenance of industrial machines should be carried out on a regular basis.'
 '- Effects of the mining industry on the environment: Mining and processing activities have negative effects on the environment if not done carefully. The sections below describe some of the effects of mining on the environment.\n- Pollution: Mining activities can lead to water, air, and noise pollution. To begin with, mining produces waste materials which pollute water bodies. For example, chemicals used in processing minerals such as mercury and sodium cyanide can pollute rivers, lakes, and underground water. This may cause the loss of life of living organisms, which depend on water. Large amounts of dust released into the air affect people, plants, and animals found in nearby areas. Also, the blasting process causes noise and vibration which affect people and their properties in nearby areas.'

The development and expansion of international tourism has led to the creation of various job opportunities. Similarly, the tourism industry has led to job creation in rural areas, thereby reducing levels of rural-urban migration. An example can be cited from the area around Mount Kilimanjaro and Arusha in Tanzania where people secure jobs as porters, translators and guides on a sustainable basis.  \nAs a result, both skilled and unskilled personnel find employment in the sector as well as the hospitality industry; hence they improve their standards of living.'
 '- Involving the local communities: Involvement of local communities will promote a sustainable tourism industry. Indeed, protection of national parks and game reserves needs the commitment of the people living near the parks and game reserves. Moreover, communities should enjoy the benefits obtained from the use of protected areas by tourists.\n- Promotion of domestic tourism: Domestic tourism is not well-developed in Tanzania because of the high costs and lack of touring interest among natives. Therefore, domestic tourism should be promoted by offering affordable rates to natives. Also, eco-tourism should be established.\n- Lessons drawn to promote the tourism industry in Tanzania: The following are some of the lessons that can be drawn from focal studies discussed in relation to promoting the tourism industry in Tanzania.'
 '- Provision of training: Tourism is a service industry that demands quality services for its sustainability. It is, therefore, important to have trained personnel who can offer quality services to meet international standards. This, in turn, will lead to increased influx of tourists.\n- Development of tourist attractions: The government should invest in expanding the tourist attractions in the country. This can be done by opening up new areas and diversifying tourist activities but also by promoting them as viable alternatives.\n- Improvement of infrastructure: There is a need to improve the existing accommodation, transport and communication infrastructure. This will improve the provision of services needed by tourists in the hospitality industry.'
 'Many people have secured jobs in the tourism industry, for example, hotel staff, tour guides and drivers. Others are employed in the local handicrafts industry such as wood carving from Okavango and Caprivi and basketry from Himba. The tourist industry also contributes to the earning of a lot of foreign currency; for example, earnings from travel agencies, hotels and restaurants, entertainment groups and shops, as well as the National Reserve. The transport and communication network around tourist attractions have also been improved. This has benefited both the tourism industry and local communities. The provision of education, health services, water supply and electricity have improved as a result of the development of the tourism industry. This has, in turn, contributed to improvement of the standard of living of the people. Furthermore, tourism contributes to the growth of GDP, hence making it a valuable sector within the country.

The energy can be derived from sunlight, tides, wind, water, geothermal, or hydroelectric action. Likewise, energy produced from the refining of various forms of biomass is often classified as renewable. The renewable energy sources are usually regarded as environmentally friendly because they release few chemicals that can harm the environment. These are energy resources that are naturally reused. Renewable sources are sustainable if they are carefully managed and maintained. They have minimal negative effects on the environment. Renewable energy sources include sunlight, geothermal heat, wind, tides, water, and various forms of biomass. Some of these energy sources are described in the following sub-sections.'
 '#### Importance of solar and wind energy in USA:  \nUSA finds it more economical to use solar and wind energy than other sources of energy as they have minimal environmental effects. Solar and wind energy in USA is important in so many ways.  \nEnvironmentally-friendly: The production of solar and wind energy involves activities which produce less waste in the environment compared to other sources of energy. These energies, therefore, are considered to be environmentally-friendly. For example, their production reduces the emission of carbon-dioxide and other pollutants.  \nCreation of employment opportunities: Installation and management of solar panels and wind mills require many employees. This industry generates jobs for thousands of people.'
 'Renewable and non-renewable energy: Renewable energy is energy generated from sources that are essentially inexhaustible. Examples of renewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, geothermal energy, tidal power, and hydroelectric power. Non-renewable energy includes conventional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which are likely to get depleted with use.  \nConventional and non-conventional energy: Conventional energy is an energy source which is fixed in nature like oil, gas, coal, and hydropower generation. It is also termed as non-renewable energy or thermal energy. The conventional energy resources are being used extensively; as a result, their known reserves have been depleted to a great extent. The use of conventional energy has emerging effects on the environment. The non-conventional energy involves energy generated by wind, tides, solar and biomass. These are renewable sources of energy and not exhaustible.'
 '### Solar and wind energy harnessing in USA  \nUSA is one of the leading countries in the world harnessing energy from the Sun. Before 2008, much of the electricity was generated from other sources such as fossil fuel and HEP. By 2018, solar power accounted for 1.44 percent of the total USA electricity, generating about 58.9 terawatt-hours (TWH).  \nUSA needs energy that is secure, reliable, protective of the environment, and able to address climate change, create jobs and improve public health. USA reduced the use of fossil fuel as a source of energy because it is expensive and not renewable.

The higher the quality of gadgets available, the more the amount of energy produced. It is, therefore, advisable to install enough wind turbines and solar panels over a wide area to increase the amount of energy harnessed.  \nResearch: Research on solar and wind energy is likely to find some solutions to many challenges facing the production of energy from wind and the sun. Research may involve studying the behaviour of wind and new technologies for tapping solar energy day and night.'
 '#### Challenges facing solar and wind energy in USA:  \nAlthough USA has a large and strong economy, it faces challenges related to the wind and solar energy sector. The following are some of the challenges.  \nSolar panel efficiency: Most solar power panels are 10 – 20 percent efficient, as they are stationary and cannot move to capture the sun’s rays. That being the case, a large percentage of the energy from the sun remains largely untapped, although the cost of solar power has decreased.  \nReliability: Solar and wind energy are not reliable sources of energy because sunrays and wind happen naturally and human beings can hardly control their occurrence. The extent of solar and wind energy production will largely depend on the intensity of wind and sunrays and the technology available to tap them.'
 '### Challenges facing power and energy production  \nPower and energy production is facing many challenges. Some of these are described below.  \n- Drought: Prolonged droughts decrease the volume of water, which in turn reduces the ability of hydro-electric power plants to produce electricity.\n- Inadequate capital: The construction of dams and hydro-electric power stations requires heavy capital outlays. Capital is also essential in the production and transportation of natural gas. Unfortunately, many developing countries lack capital to harness fossil fuel and hydropower potentials.\n- Transport and communication networks: These are inadequate in many developing countries, which hinders the extraction or transmission of energy and power.\n- Poor technology and lack of skilled personnel: Some energy and power production systems such as nuclear, tidal, and geothermal energy require advanced technology, which is lacking in most developing countries.'

Clean cotton is packed into sacks and transported to ginneries for removing seeds from lint. The lint is compressed into large bales and transported to textile industries or exported.'
 '##### Harvesting, processing, and transportation of wheat:  \nIn the process of harvesting, there is a need to test the crop. In this regard, fingers are used to rub the wheat head and pieces of grain are chewed. If the grains crack in the mouth and become soft as they are chewed, then they are ready for harvesting. Clean places are prepared for keeping the harvested wheat. When using a sickle for harvesting, it should be checked to make sure it is sharp enough for making clean cuts. In commercial farming, Rice the combine harvester is adjusted to harvest the wheat. Harvesting is done when the crop reaches maturity (at least 100 days). The part that is harvested is called kernels. Freshly harvested wheat is taken to a local grain elevator as soon as possible after harvest.'
 '#### Harvesting, processing and transportation of sisal:  \nHarvesting of sisal begins when the colour of thorns at the tips changes from dark brown to light-brown. The processing of leaves should take place 48 hours after being harvested. Through processing, sisal fibres are obtained whereby the leaves are crushed between rollers and then mechanically scraped. Then the fibres are washed and dried. Drying of fibres is done in the sun or by using drying machines. This is followed by brushing of the dried fibres for straightening as well as polishing. Thereafter, the fibres are graded depending on their length and colour. It is important to ensure cleanliness of the bale. Graded fibres are then packed into bales either manually or by using machines.'
 '##### Harvesting, processing and transportation of maize:  \nMaize can be harvested after 3 - 6 months depending on variations in temperature and seed types. Harvesting methods include manual hand cut and machines (combine harvesters).

 '#### Small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop cultivation is the growing of crops on a small piece of land. It is also called subsistence farming. It aims to produce enough food for the wellbeing of families. In some instances, when the production is high, the surplus is sold. Individuals engaging in small-scale crop cultivation are known as peasants. They are also called subsistence farmers as they grow food crops to feed themselves and their families with little or no surplus for sale.  \nAs noted earlier, the agricultural system at subsistence level falls under this category. A farmer owns a small piece of land for food crops cultivation. The produce is enough only for the family. It is hand to mouth existence which may lead to famine if the harvest is bad. In years with good harvest the farmer may have surplus to sell to the local markets. The farms are small, about one to five hectares owned by the family. Application of machines is difficult as farms are small.'

Through agriculture the country also earns foreign currency, which helps to increase the National Domestic Product (NDP) through the export of beverages and other processed foods. Improvement of standards of living of the people who live near plantations such as the Cotton and Corn belts is another contribution of large-scale agriculture in the USA. Furthermore, the country has benefited significantly from development and growth of beef and dairy farming industries, which employ the largest percentage, followed by bakery, fruit and vegetable plants. The agricultural sector also plays a role in stimulating the development and growth of towns and cities such as Chicago and St. Louis.'
 '### Challenges facing large-scale agriculture in USA:  \nThere are several challenges facing large-scale agriculture in the USA. Some of them are high cost of production as agriculture in the USA is highly mechanised. Automatic irrigation and agricultural machinery require fossil fuels and other sources of energy to run them. The increase in the price of fossil fuel, therefore, increases the cost of production. At times, there is a shortage of water as irrigation requires a lot of water. The amount of underground water drawn for irrigation is increasing whereas the amount of water to refill is decreasing; which results in shortage of water for agricultural use. Another problem has to do with loss of soil fertility as the soil is eroded faster than it can be replenished due to over- cultivation. Also, over-irrigation causes leaching of soil nutrients.'
 '### Contribution of crop production to the economy of the United States of America  \nThe United States of America (USA) has a diverse climate and the ability to grow a wide variety of crops across the vast country with 50 states. Agriculture is a major industry in the USA, which is a net exporter of food. Although agricultural activity occurs in every state, it is particularly concentrated in the Great Plains, a vast expanse of flat, arable land at the center of the nation in the region around the Great Lakes known as the Corn Belt. Corn is another name for maize which is a chief cereal crop. The economy of the USA heavily depends on manufacturing industries. However, it is so diversified and characterized with a variety of sectors including services, entertainment, telecommunications and agriculture.'
 '### The concept of agriculture  \nAgriculture is a science which deals with crop cultivation and livestock keeping. It is the oldest human activity which has been practiced by many societies in the world. Through agriculture, human beings grow crops for use by households and supply to industries. Factors influencing agriculture include climate, water availability, soil characteristics and terrain. Agriculture is also influenced by availability of financial resources, infrastructure, technology and markets.'
 'Access to water is fundamental to economic and social development. However, population growth, rapid urbanisation and industrialisation, the expansion of agriculture and tourism, and climate change all put water under increasing stress. This situation has impacted negatively the socio-economic development of most developing countries. As a result, at the global level, there is a major concern regarding the management of water resources. Water resources management emerged as a response to real and foreseen water crises and increasingly unsustainable pressure on the freshwater resources, which emanate from rising populations, growing demands for water due to competing water uses, and increasing pollution.'

29,"Please, I need a detailed question where students explain different categories of manufacturing",Explain the different categories of manufacturing industries mentioned in the textbook.,"['### Types of manufacturing industries  \nManufacturing industries can be grouped into two main types, namely, processing and fabrication industries.'
 '### The concept of manufacturing industry  \nThe manufacturing industry involves the processing and changing of raw materials into different semi-finished or finished products using tools and machines. It plays a major role in bringing about the development of a country. The ever-growing population with increased demands for goods and services is accommodated by the establishment of manufacturing industries. Such increased population demands more food, shelter, clothes and other services. The following section explains the importance of manufacturing industries in the world.'
 '#### Types of manufacturing industries in East Africa:  \nThere are different types of manufacturing industries in East Africa. They can be grouped as follows:\ni. Food and beverage industries\nii. Chemical industries\niii. Textile industries\niv. Mineral extraction industries\nv. Iron and steel industries: They make iron and steel bars, wires, and other iron and steel products.\nvi. Lumbering industries: These industries deal with the production of timber, wood pulp and other products from wood. Paper industries rely on softwood which grows fast.\nvii. Fuel and power industries: These industries deal with the extraction of oil, petroleum, coal, natural gas, and refining and generation of power from various sources such as steam and coal.'
 '### The importance of manufacturing industries:  \n- (a) Manufacturing industries are sources of employment for both skilled and unskilled labour. These employees can raise their standards of living and improve quality of life with the income they earn. The income they earn caters for basic needs such as food, shelter, clothes and education.\n- (b) Manufacturing industries also lead to the diversification of the country’s economy due to their potentials for promoting other sectors of the economy. This reduces over-dependence on one or two economic sectors, which can be affected by fluctuation of prices in the world market.\n- (c) Manufacturing industries enable countries to process locally produced raw materials before they are exported. This process helps to add value to the exports.'
 '- (d) Manufacturing industries stimulate the development of infrastructure such as railways and roads. These means of transport are useful in carrying raw materials to manufacturing centers and the finished or unfinished goods to the markets.\n- (e) Industries also help to create a large internal market as workers get wages and salaries from industries which enable them to buy goods and services. In fact, the more the workers, the larger the market for manufacturing industries.\n- (f) Manufacturing industries also lead to increased agricultural production. For example, the textile industry requires cotton as raw material. Thus, it can stimulate the expansion of cotton growing.\n- (g) Manufacturing industries are sources of foreign currency. The products manufactured in a country are exported to other countries for sale which, in turn, attract foreign currency.'

30,can you prepare a defining question for natural gas sector in Tanzania?,"What are the regions in Tanzania where natural gas is predominantly found, and where is natural gas produced in Tanzania?","['In Tanzania, natural gas is found in the southern parts of the country, particularly in Mtwara, Lindi, and Ruvuma regions. Specifically, natural gas is produced at Songosongo, Mnazi Bay, Msimbati, Kiliwani North, and Ntorya. Furthermore, exploration of natural gas and petroleum is going on in Tanzania and there are signs of their availability in other coastal regions and islands of Tanzania. In recent years, the exploration has indicated the availability of petroleum and natural gas in Pemba – Zanzibar.  \nThe major producers of petroleum and natural gas in the world include USA, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Russia, Nigeria, Gabon, Libya, Kuwait, Algeria, Angola, Venezuela, Mexico, and Egypt.'
 '#### Challenges of natural gas production in Tanzania:  \nNatural gas production faces numerous challenges in different aspects. Natural gas is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, care has to be when extracting this resource. Natural gas production is new in Tanzania and, thus, it faces a shortage of skilled labour, especially in exploration and extraction activities. As a result, the government is often forced to employ foreign experts who are paid high salaries. Regarding the capacity to produce the natural gas, Tanzania has not been able to allocate enough funds for exploration, extraction, processing and distribution.'
 '#### Tanzania’s efforts in addressing the challenges of natural gas production  \nTanzania has been trying to overcome the challenges associated with the production of its natural gas. The government has been emphasising the use of revenue from natural gas to benefit the people in the areas producing the gas and the nation as a whole. The revenue from natural gas is used to improve social services in education and health. There have been various public programmes aimed to educate the public on natural gas benefits. The ministries responsible for energy and mineral resources in Tanzania conduct awareness creation programmes through various ways such as meetings and the media. The government also provides opportunities for training to Tanzanians in oil and natural gas. These training opportunities aim to build the country’s capacity for exploration, extraction, processing and supplying of natural gas.'
 'Tanzania benefits a lot from its natural gas resources. The resources benefit the economy of the country but also improve the lives of its people. Natural gas has contributed to the improvement of infrastructure. Transport and communication systems to and from source of natural gas areas have been improved. For example, the discovery and extraction of gas in Mtwara Region has stimulated improvement of the airport and the harbour in the region. As a result, air transport to and from Mtwara Region has also improved. Natural gas has also created the demand for labour, goods and services. There has been an increase in the demand for both skilled and unskilled labour to work in the mines and carry out mining-related activities. Moreover, natural gas extraction has added a source of income for the people. Companies involved in natural gas extraction usually pay taxes and other dues to the government. People living nearby natural gas extraction fields also benefit by selling goods,'
 '#### Natural gas production in Tanzania  \nNatural gas has been discovered at Songosongo in Kilwa and Mnazi Bay in Mtwara. The estimated natural gas reserve for Tanzania is 52 trillion cubic feet. The natural gas is mined and transported through pipelines to Dar es Salaam where it is used to generate electricity. Private companies such as Songas, Pan African Energy Tanzania (PAET), Maurel and Prom (MOP) in co-operation with the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) produce natural gas. Songas generates electricity using gas from the Songosongo Island gas fields.

Through agriculture the country also earns foreign currency, which helps to increase the National Domestic Product (NDP) through the export of beverages and other processed foods. Improvement of standards of living of the people who live near plantations such as the Cotton and Corn belts is another contribution of large-scale agriculture in the USA. Furthermore, the country has benefited significantly from development and growth of beef and dairy farming industries, which employ the largest percentage, followed by bakery, fruit and vegetable plants. The agricultural sector also plays a role in stimulating the development and growth of towns and cities such as Chicago and St. Louis.'
 '### Challenges facing large-scale agriculture in USA:  \nThere are several challenges facing large-scale agriculture in the USA. Some of them are high cost of production as agriculture in the USA is highly mechanised. Automatic irrigation and agricultural machinery require fossil fuels and other sources of energy to run them. The increase in the price of fossil fuel, therefore, increases the cost of production. At times, there is a shortage of water as irrigation requires a lot of water. The amount of underground water drawn for irrigation is increasing whereas the amount of water to refill is decreasing; which results in shortage of water for agricultural use. Another problem has to do with loss of soil fertility as the soil is eroded faster than it can be replenished due to over- cultivation. Also, over-irrigation causes leaching of soil nutrients.'
 '### Contribution of crop production to the economy of the United States of America  \nThe United States of America (USA) has a diverse climate and the ability to grow a wide variety of crops across the vast country with 50 states. Agriculture is a major industry in the USA, which is a net exporter of food. Although agricultural activity occurs in every state, it is particularly concentrated in the Great Plains, a vast expanse of flat, arable land at the center of the nation in the region around the Great Lakes known as the Corn Belt. Corn is another name for maize which is a chief cereal crop. The economy of the USA heavily depends on manufacturing industries. However, it is so diversified and characterized with a variety of sectors including services, entertainment, telecommunications and agriculture.'
 'Other challenges include the high cost of land management in large-scale agriculture where monoculture is a common practise. Monoculture exhausts nutrients from the soil that requires constant application of fertilisers. Natural disasters such as drought, hurricanes, floods and tornadoes also pose severe challenges to agricultural production. Crops are damaged by periodic drought, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes. This damage leads to low production which, ultimately, affects the economy. The natural disasters also affect transportation network which finally hinders the movement of agricultural products from the field to storage and market centers.'

32,Can you provide a defining question about plant transpiration for my form 2 students?,What factors influence evapotranspiration according to the context provided in the textbook for Form 2 Geography students?,"['### Evapotranspiration  \nEvapotranspiration refers to the process whereby water is transferred from the land to the air through plant roots and leaves. Water from the land is carried by roots to the leaves, a process known as transpiration, and then from the leaves it changes into vapour and moves into the atmosphere through the process of evaporation. The combination of these two processes form what is termed as evapotranspiration (Evaporation + transpiration = evapotranspiration). Evapotranspiration is determined by factors such as temperature, humidity, wind, soil, and type of plants. These factors are hereby explained.'
 '#### Wind:  \nWind affects evapotranspiration by keeping air in constant movement. This movement increases the rate of evapotranspiration as it clears any humidity around the plants, hence increasing the rate of transpiration.'
 'The leaves develop thorny leaves or a waxy surface to reduce loss of water through transpiration. Plants develop deep roots in the ground to reach water. Other plants develop storage organs. For example, a baobab tree stores water in its trunk. Some plants shed their leaves during periods of water scarcity. The relationship between vegetation and water supply may be influenced by human activities such as water drilling and deforestation. Water drilling may increase water supply in areas with water scarcity and, thus, influence the growth of the planted vegetation. On the other hand, deforestation exposes the area previously covered by the forest to evaporation and thus destroys the catchment areas. As a matter of fact, deforestation may turn an area into arid or semi-arid land.'
 '#### Temperature:  \nAn increase in temperature accelerates the rate of evaporation. During the warm season, plants open their stomata (pores) and release water in the form of water vapour. During the cold season, plants close their stomata and prohibit the release of water. 10% of the moisture in the atmosphere is contributed by the release of water from plants.  \nFigure 3.2: Evaporation from ocean water  \nFigure 3.3: Evapotranspiration'
 '### Condensation  \nCondensation is the process whereby water in its gaseous form changes into liquid. The moist warm air from water bodies and plants moves upwards where there is very low temperature. Then it reaches a dew point (point at which water condenses) and forms clouds. Clouds are masses of water droplets which continue to accumulate and when they are saturated, they become dense and fall as rain. Condensation is a very essential process in the hydrological cycle because it leads to the formation of clouds which produce rainfall (Figure 3.4). Rainfall is the main route through which water returns to the earth’s surface.  \nFigure 3.4 Heavy clouds in the air\nSource: ruvumapress.blogspot.com-mawingu mazito'

It is one of the largest river basins in Africa, and covers an area of about 177,420 km2. This basin occupies 20 percent of the country. It occupies parts of Iringa, Njombe, Mbeya, Ruvuma, Morogoro, Dodoma and Pwani Regions (Figure 3.8).The basin contains the Rufiji River which is the largest river in Tanzania. It originates from the south-western highlands. It has four main tributaries, namely, the Great Ruaha, Kilombero, Luwegu and the Rufiji lower section. These four tributaries join to form the Rufiji River.'
 'There are several socio-economic activities within the basin which benefit individuals and the nation. These include agriculture, tourism, hydropower generation,fisheries, mining and livestock keeping. Land in the Rufiji Basin is used mainly for agriculture, tourism, wildlife conservation, fisheries and mining. Agriculture is mainly practised in the Usangu Plain in Mbeya and Kilombero Basin in Morogoro.  \nApart from being rich in water resources and biodiversity, the basin is endowed with a good climate, fertile soil, minerals and human resources. It is known for its agricultural production and is often called the “bread basket” of Tanzania. Within the basin, there are important national parks (Kitulo, Ruaha, Mikumi, Udzungwa and Uluguru), large game reserves (the lower part of Selous, Rungwa, Usangu, Mpanga/ Kipengere, and Lunda), forest reserves, and pasture for livestock. Fishery is practised in the Kilombero, Great Ruaha and Rufiji rivers.'
 '3. Climate related problems like drought have been affecting water availability; sometimes the volume of water in the river decreases. Climatic changes are experienced in most parts of Tanzania including Rufiji Basin, with prolonged drought and unreliable rainfall leading to insufficient water supply. This situation affects food production in the basin, sugar plantations, HEP and wildlife.\n4. Transport problems prevail, especially during rainy season during which the area is not always accessible.  \nFigure 3.8 The Rufiji River Basin in Tanzania'
 'Mining projects are developed in the Selous Basin at Namtumbo District where Uranium is developed and copper project in Iringa District at Nyang’oro Hills. Because of its large agricultural, hydroelectric and other potentials, the basin is the focus of the Government of Tanzania, donor and private development plans. It has also attracted large numbers of people migrating to the area seeking land for cropping and raising livestock. According to the national census of 2012, the districts within the basin had 9,032,089 people compared to 3,055,051 in 2002. It also contains Kihansi spray toads, which are a unique species for tourist attraction.

34,Describe the challenges facing renewable energy implementation in the USA for a detailed answer.,What are some challenges facing solar and wind energy production in the USA?,"['#### Challenges facing solar and wind energy in USA:  \nAlthough USA has a large and strong economy, it faces challenges related to the wind and solar energy sector. The following are some of the challenges.  \nSolar panel efficiency: Most solar power panels are 10 – 20 percent efficient, as they are stationary and cannot move to capture the sun’s rays. That being the case, a large percentage of the energy from the sun remains largely untapped, although the cost of solar power has decreased.  \nReliability: Solar and wind energy are not reliable sources of energy because sunrays and wind happen naturally and human beings can hardly control their occurrence. The extent of solar and wind energy production will largely depend on the intensity of wind and sunrays and the technology available to tap them.'
 '#### Addressing challenges facing solar and wind energy in USA:  \nThe challenges facing solar and wind energy production may hinder the expected harnessing of this potential energy if deliberate efforts are not made to address them.  \nInstallation of wind turbines and solar panels: Solar and wind energy depends very much on the number and quality of wind turbines and solar panels. The higher the quality of gadgets available, the more the amount of energy produced. It is, therefore, advisable to install enough wind turbines and solar panels over a wide area to increase the amount of energy harnessed.  \nResearch: Research on solar and wind energy is likely to find some solutions to many challenges facing the production of energy from wind and the sun. Research may involve studying the behaviour of wind and new technologies for tapping solar energy day and night.'
 '### Solar and wind energy harnessing in USA  \nUSA is one of the leading countries in the world harnessing energy from the Sun. Before 2008, much of the electricity was generated from other sources such as fossil fuel and HEP. By 2018, solar power accounted for 1.44 percent of the total USA electricity, generating about 58.9 terawatt-hours (TWH).  \nUSA needs energy that is secure, reliable, protective of the environment, and able to address climate change, create jobs and improve public health. USA reduced the use of fossil fuel as a source of energy because it is expensive and not renewable. The American Government reduces the cost of solar power and increases the cost of fossil fuel to encourage use of the former. USA, as a highly developed country in terms of technology and economy, has a very high demand for power and energy for industrial and domestic use.'
 'Industrial development: In USA, solar and wind energy have been found to be feasible sources of alternative energy for industrial development. The energy generated is considered cheaper than other available sources of energy such as fossil energy, HEP, natural gas, and nuclear energy.  \nExpansion of agriculture: Large-scale agriculture has been made possible by the availability of electricity from this source. The power is used in irrigation and processing of agricultural products.  \nAffordability: Solar and wind energy are relatively cheaper for many people in USA especially those who are unable to use other sources of electricity because it is subsidized by the government. This has improved their living standards.'
 'Renewable energy sources: Renewable energy is any energy source that is naturally replaced. The energy can be derived from sunlight, tides, wind, water, geothermal, or hydroelectric action. Likewise, energy produced from the refining of various forms of biomass is often classified as renewable. The renewable energy sources are usually regarded as environmentally friendly because they release few chemicals that can harm the environment. These are energy resources that are naturally reused. Renewable sources are sustainable if they are carefully managed and maintained. They have minimal negative effects on the environment. Renewable energy sources include sunlight, geothermal heat, wind, tides, water, and various forms of biomass. Some of these energy sources are described in the following sub-sections.'

 '#### Negative impact of tourism:  \nThe negative impact of tourism includes the following:  \nTourism has sometimes led to cultural interference and conflicts. Sometimes tourists bring with them practices that are unacceptable to the people in the host country, for example, ways of dressing, food style, and language. Moral decay has occurred in places that are visited by tourists. For example, cases of prostitution, same-sex relationships (homosexuality), and drug abuse have become common in areas with tourist attractions such as beaches and nightclubs.  \nIn addition, tourist activities in national parks and other protected areas may lead to environmental degradation such as off road driving and dumping of waste such as paper and plastics.  \nMoreover, the continued presence of people and vehicles in the tourists sites may lead to change in animal behaviours.'

There are two types of forests: natural and man-made (planted) forests.  \n##### Planted forests:  \nPlanted forests are those in which trees are planted by human beings. They are commonly known as grown trees. The trees may be obtained locally or from other countries. In Tanzania, mahogany and teak are examples of local species whereas pines and eucalyptus are species from other countries. Some examples of planted forests in Tanzania include The Sao Hill forest plantation in Mafinga, Iringa Region and The West Kilimanjaro forest plantation in Kilimanjaro Region.'
 '#### Planted forests:  \nPlanted forests refer to a collection of trees by human beings. These forests cover relatively large areas of land. Figure 4.7 shows part of a planted forest at Sao Hill in Iringa. Trees in these forests are of specific value such as commercial or land conservation. Planted forests are usually grown on a large-scale or small-scale basis. In many cases governments and companies or groups of people establish large-scale forests while small groups of people or individuals establish small-scale forests. In Tanzania, notable planted forests are in Iringa, Kagera, Kigoma, Kilimanjaro, and Arusha regions. Trees are established through seeding and planting of either native or exotic species. These forests are properly managed from planting to harvesting time to ensure high productivity.'
 '#### Characteristics of planted forests:  \nThe major characteristic of planted forests is pat pey are composed of trees which result from deliberate influence or intervention of human beings. However, pere are oper characteristics which distinguish pem from natural forests.  \nMost of the planted trees are of the same species because forest growers aim at specific tree species for targeted value. For example, at Sao Hill, most of the trees are pine and eucalyptus. Usually, trees in planted forests are of the same age because they are planted at the same time though the growth speed of the trees may vary. The difference in growth may cause them to be harvested at different periods. In addition, the difference in the harvesting of trees in planted forests may be caused by a system of planting trees in blocks.'
 'Human beings obtain various products and services from forests. Forest products can be timber and non-timber products that help to sustain human life. Non-timber forest products include fruits, honey, leaves, roots and barks. The process of managing forest resources for human use is known as forestry. Foresters engage in lumbering, which is an activity that involves cutting, transporting, processing and selling timber. The terms ‘timber’ and ‘log’ are used interchangeably to mean branches or pieces of the trunk of a tree, but with the bark attached. Harvesting of forest resources is generally sustainable when there is no or little damage to the general environment. A forest can be natural or planted. Animals, birds and insects use forests to support their lives. Forests provide aesthetic value and services to human beings.'
 'Planted forests are regularly cleaned by removing unwanted undergrowth, which may hinder the healthy growth of the planted species. Foresters provide close and strict supervision from planting to harvesting because of the commercial value of the trees. For example, planted trees in Sao Hill are for electrical polls, paper-making and timber production. Timber is sold locally or exported.'

37,generate an explaining question about the traits of nomadic pastoralism,What are some of the disadvantages associated with nomadic pastoralism according to the textbook information provided?,"['#### Characteristics of nomadic pastoralism:  \nThe nomads normally move in groups. These groups are formed through the integration of families or members of a given ethnic group. A group involves a chief or elders who make decisions for the entire group. Indeed, large herd tends to cause overgrazing. Overgrazing is a situation where the number of cattle is greater than the carrying capacity of the grazing land. As a result, overgrazing causes soil erosion, land degradation, and loss of valuable species. Another feature of the nomadic pastoralists is the breeding process, which is uncontrolled. This situation may lead to the spread and outbreak of animal diseases, hence low animal quality and deaths.  \nIn addition, there is poor control of pests and other diseases, which result to poor quality of animal products. Furthermore, nomadic pastoralism takes place where the population is scarce as the animals are grazed in open range, which needs a lot of space.'
 '#### Disadvantages of nomadic pastoralism:  \nNomadic pastoralism suffers from lack of processing and storage facilities, hence causing a significant loss of the products. Also, over-grazing under nomadic pastoralism leads to soil erosion. Moreover, the control of diseases is difficult since animals are always on the move, which can affect the health of the animals and lower productivity in the process. For example, there have been cases of loss of large numbers of livestock due to lack of water and pasture. This situation affects the economy of the pastoralists. Furthermore, the practise of nomadic pastoralism tends to cause conflicts as they interfere with crop cultivators’ land. Because of their nomadic nature, many of the pastoralists’ children fail to attend formal education. As such, their periodic movements result in many of these children being denied their right to education and associated opportunities.'
 'Nomadic pastoralism involves continual movement of pastoralists with large numbers of animals from place to place in search of pasture and water. People involved in this practice are called nomads or pastoralists. Tribes which practise nomadic pastoralism include the Maasai, Barbaig, Kwavi, and Karamajong. Nomadic pastoralism is mostly practised in sparsely populated areas where the natural vegetation is mainly grass and bushes and, sometimes, scattered trees. In these areas, rainfall is very low and unreliable. The pastoralists follow specific routes in their movements. Figure 2.10 shows a large herd of cattle. The animals kept by pastoralists are a source of food and income through the selling of animals and their products. Major products from animals are meat and milk. The pastoralists spend the money they earn to meet family needs such as buying cereals, paying school fees, and meeting health expenses. In addition, the cattle raised are used for paying bride price and giving gifts'
 '#### Advantages of nomadic pastoralism:  \n- Generally, managing livestock using traditional methods under nomadic pastoralism is cheap. It also ensures the availability of food to the family.\n- In addition, indigenous species of cattle such as Zebu, Boran, and Ankole are resistant to diseases.\n- Furthermore, the animals can tolerate walking over long distances and withstanding other environmental hardships such as high temperatures. They can also stay for a long time without water.\n- Likewise, the cattle are cheap to manage in terms of shelter.'
 'In addition, low capital investment limits the development of the livestock- keeping sector in the country. Also, inadequate land for grazing leads to conflicts between farmers and pastoralists. Nomadic pastoralists, for example, always move from one place to another in search of pasture and water. As a result, they sometimes graze on the farms, hence conflicts arise between them and farmers. With nomadic pastoralism, the animals get tired due to long distances over which they move. Sometimes, the animals get sick and die, thus leading to low production in terms of quality and quantity.  \n##### Ways of solving challenges facing livestock-keeping in Tanzania:'

38,"Hello, i need one statement that is true or false on the benefits of commercial livestock farming",Statement: Commercial livestock-keeping stimulates the growth of industries that process different animal-related products as raw materials.,"['#### Advantages of commercial livestock-keeping:  \nCommercial livestock-keeping acts as a source of raw materials for industries such as food processing, shoe, and cloth making. It is one of the sectors which employs people and serves as a source of government revenue. Commercial livestock-keeping provides food products such as meat and milk consumed by households and industries. Moreover, it contributes to the production of goods such as shoes, bags, and animal foods. The benefits of commercial livestock-keeping include the ability to utilize breeds that can enhance reproductive performance. This practice also stimulates the development of transport and communication. Commercial livestock-keeping also facilitates the control of diseases and pests because it limits animal movement. It also uses high technology and scientific methods in management.'
 '### Commercial livestock-keeping  \nCommercial livestock-keeping involves rearing of animals for the purpose of selling their products such as meat, milk, wool and hides. Ranching, as part of commercial livestock-keeping, is mostly practised in more remote areas where land is extensive and population density is low. Extensive land provides sufficient grass to support a large number of animals. Commercial livestock-keeping is determined by factors such as capital, level of technology, market, availability of pasture and climatic conditions. In temperate regions, supplementary food such as hay and root crops are used to feed them during winter. Animals are kept for meat (beef cattle), for milk (dairy cattle and camel) and for wool (sheep).'
 '#### Benefits of livestock-keeping:  \nLivestock-keeping stimulates the growth of industries that process different animal-related products such as hides, horns, and hooves as raw materials. It is also a source of income by selling animals and their products. In addition, livestock-keeping provides employment to people, which helps to improve their living conditions. Moreover, livestock-keeping contributes to government revenue.'
 '#### Characteristics of commercial livestock-keeping  \nCommercial livestock-keeping takes place on a large area with low population density. More space is needed for the construction of ranches and growing grass for feeding livestock. Generally, commercial livestock-keeping is practiced in more remote areas where other forms of land use are limited. Usually, one type of animal is kept for quality control of products. In addition, commercial livestock-keeping is capital-intensive as it demands money for buying land, paying for labor, fencing, and buying machines and equipment. Furthermore, crossbreeding in commercial livestock-keeping is an important management practice.'
 ""### Livestock-keeping  \nLivestock-keeping is the rearing of animals and poultry for food and commercial purposes. The word 'livestock' applies primarily to cattle or dairy cows, goats, pigs, camels, horses, mules, poultry, and sheep. The word 'livestock' applies primarily to cattle or dairy cows, goats, pigs, camels, horses, mules, poultry and sheep. Poultry includes ducks, chicken, turkey, and geese. The population growth and ever increasing demand for food supply lead to the growth of livestock-keeping. Livestock-keeping contributes to the economic development of a country since it is a source of food as well as raw materials for industries. It is also a source of income as well as employment opportunities. Besides, it is a source of foreign currency.""

39,Generate a true or false statement about the overview of transportation.,True or False: Transport is an important sector that has no significant impact on the socio-economic development of the world.,"['### The concept of transport  \nTransport refers to the physical movement of people, goods and services from one place to another. It is an important link between different parts of the world. Transport is one of the key sectors that play a crucial role in efforts aimed to achieve sustainable economic growth. The transport system ensures a balanced distribution of goods and services in different parts of the world. Transport is an important sector that enhances the socio-economic development of the world. For the transport sector to play its important role, it has to be developed and co-ordinated with the ultimate aim of bringing about a reliable, efficient, safe and environmentally-sound system of moving passengers and goods.'
 '- Creation of employment opportunities: The transport sector generates employment opportunities for drivers, conductors, pilots, cabin crew, and ship captains. In addition, it creates jobs for people indirectly in the industries that make various parts or machines and other transport equipment as well as those involved in construction and maintenance.\n- Enhancing the standard of living: Easy means of transport facilitates large-scale production of goods at a low cost. It gives consumers opportunity to choose from a variety of goods. As such, transport helps to raise the standards of living for the people.\n- Facilitating movement during emergencies and natural calamities: During crises, such as war or internal disturbances such as earthquakes, floods and fire outbreaks, transport helps to quicken the movement of troops and relief supplies needed in the rescure operation.'
 'Road transport: Road transport is a means of transport that connects one place to another on the surface of the earth. It is the most common means of transport used all over the world. Transport on roads can be grouped into the transport of goods and people. Movement along roads may be done by bike or automobile, truck, or by animals such as horses, donkeys or oxen. Cargo may be transported by trucking companies, while passengers may be transported via mass transit. Road transport is the most frequently used mode of transport in the world. It involves the use of various types of animals, vehicles, motorcycles and bicycles. Roads play a great role in socio-economic development. In most cases, the delivery of goods between cities, towns and villages is facilitated by road transport. The advantage of road transport over other modes of transport is that it even operates where other means of transport are not available.'
 '### Main types of transport  \nTransport is categorised into land, air and water systems as illustrated in Figure 9.1:  \nLand transport: Land transport involves the movement of people, goods and services from one location to another, on land. It is the most commonly used mode of transportation in the world. Land transport may further be divided into road transport, rail transport, cable transport and pipeline transport. The description of each mode of transport is provided in the sections that follow.'
 '- Helping labour mobility: Transport helps in providing mobility to workers. It facilitates movement of workers from one country to another country, to work in different economic sectors.\n- Promotion of international relations: Transport facilitates the movement of people from one country to another. It helps promote the exchange of cultures, views and practises between people of different nationalities. This exchange brings about greater understanding among the people and awareness about different countries and their cultures. Thus, it helps to promote a feeling of international brotherhood.

For example, there is a luxury train that runs between Swakopmund and Windhoek. Also, Air Namibia offers several scheduled domestic flights to enhance tourist movements. The private sector is also working closely with the government to improve accommodation facilities.'
 '- Financial resources: Despite the efforts made by the government to allocate funds for transport development, the amount is far below what is actually required to finance and maintain the existing transport network. Thus, there is a need to engage the private sector in infrastructure development. The involvement of the private sector in infrastructural development and operations can help ease public resource constraints. The private sector has the potential of enhancing the productivity and efficiency of infrastructure services. This calls for improving the investment climate by updating institutional and regulatory frameworks and reducing bureaucratic procedures and practices.'
 '- Provision of training: Tourism is a service industry that demands quality services for its sustainability. It is, therefore, important to have trained personnel who can offer quality services to meet international standards. This, in turn, will lead to increased influx of tourists.\n- Development of tourist attractions: The government should invest in expanding the tourist attractions in the country. This can be done by opening up new areas and diversifying tourist activities but also by promoting them as viable alternatives.\n- Improvement of infrastructure: There is a need to improve the existing accommodation, transport and communication infrastructure. This will improve the provision of services needed by tourists in the hospitality industry.'
 '- Human and institutional capacity building: Efforts should be directed towards institutions to ensure that they have appropriate mandates and are staffed with highly motivated and skilled human resources. These measures should involve key elements in the development of a safe, secure, affordable and environmentally-sound transport system. Also, responsible authorities need to develop and implement capacity building programmes to upgrade the knowledge and skills of staff involved in policy formulation, planning and implementation as well as those engaged in regulatory and enforcement functions.\n- Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA): The development of a sustainable transport system, requires carrying out an environmental impact assessment. This assessment should be incorporated into the infrastructure development plans of the country. In this regard, any plan for transport construction should undergo EIA processes before approval.'
 'Tourism services also generate the much-needed foreign currency. Tourists arrive in the country with convertible currencies which boost the country’s foreign currency. Moreover, taxes from this sector contribute to the growth of the national economy. This, in turn, lead to the development of other sectors such as health, education, infrastructure and water. Furthermore, existing roads are improved and new ones are built to connect tourist attraction sites. Airports are also developed and improved.

41,Can you make assertion about the impact of In-situ leach mining?,"In-situ leach mining is a mining process used to recover minerals such as copper and uranium through boreholes drilled into a deposit, in-situ. It involves dissolving the existing mineral resource and then processing it on the surface without moving rock from the ground. This method of mining can have a lower environmental impact compared to traditional surface mining methods, as it minimizes the disturbance of the land surface by extracting minerals without the need to remove large quantities of overlying materials.","['#### In-situ mining:  \nIn-situ mining is a mining process used to recover minerals such as copper and uranium through boreholes drilled into a deposit, in-situ. It involves dissolving the existing mineral resource and then processing it on the surface without moving rock from the ground.'
 '### Methods of mining  \nMethods of mining depend on the location of the mineral in the earth’s crust. There are four methods of mining which are surface, underground, alluvial, and in-situ mining.'
 '- Land degradation: Mining causes pits on the earp’s surface. When mining is done on a large-scale, the destruction of the surrounding land is higher. Open cast mines produce much larger quantities of waste pan underground mines. These open-pit mines produce 8 to 10 times as much waste as underground mines. In some areas, breaking of rocks may cause landslides on nearby land. Landslides can damage transport routes and nearby property.\n- Destruction of land surface appearance: This may happen in areas where there are no more minerals and mining activities have stopped, and land left without being reclaimed. In the case of the open-cast method of mining, land appearance is destroyed, deep holes are left on the earth’s surface, creating problems related to soil erosion, health, and death. If the holes are filled with water, they become breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which may spread malaria.'
 '### Ways of minimising the effects of mining on the environment:  \nThe following are ways to minimise the effects of mining on the environment:  \n- Land rehabilitation: Holes produced during mining should be covered with the removed soils. Planting trees and other vegetation cover helps to repair the damaged land.\n- Proper storage and use of chemicals: It is advisable to store chemicals in a strong room so that no leakage occurs into the soil and water. Moreover, chemicals are to be used with care to avoid polluting soil and water resources.\n- Waste management: There must be a proper waste disposal from mineral processing industries. This organised disposal includes treatment of the chemicals that flow from the industries into rivers and streams. In addition, there should be dust management programmes to avoid air pollution.'
 'Surface mining is done by removing (stripping) surface vegetation, dirt, and, if necessary, layers of bedrock in order to reach buried ore deposits. Techniques of surface mining include: open-pit mining or open cast mining, which is the recovery of materials from an open pit in the ground; and quarrying, identical to open-pit mining except that it refers to sand, stone and clay. Open cast mining is the cheapest method of extracting minerals. This method is used to extract minerals which usually occur close to the earth’s surface. This method involves removing the top layers of the earth and other overlying materials above the mineral ores. Figure 5.3 shows an open cast mine. The extraction involves the use of earth moving machines and bulldozers, and electric shovels. Sometimes explosion is used to blow overlying materials in order to reach the ore beneath. This method is cheaper because the output is bigger than the costs of running. The open cast method is used to extract quarrying'

1. Subsistence farming aims to produce enough food for the wellbeing of families and involves selling a surplus when production is high.
2. Peasants engaging in subsistence farming are also known as subsistence farmers.
3. Subsistence farmers grow food crops primarily for commercial purposes and profit.
4. Small-scale crop cultivation is often practiced by families who own small pieces of land ranging from one to five hectares.
5. Subsistence farming can lead to famine if","['#### Small-scale crop cultivation:  \nSmall-scale crop cultivation is the growing of crops on a small piece of land. It is also called subsistence farming. It aims to produce enough food for the wellbeing of families. In some instances, when the production is high, the surplus is sold. Individuals engaging in small-scale crop cultivation are known as peasants. They are also called subsistence farmers as they grow food crops to feed themselves and their families with little or no surplus for sale.  \nAs noted earlier, the agricultural system at subsistence level falls under this category. A farmer owns a small piece of land for food crops cultivation. The produce is enough only for the family. It is hand to mouth existence which may lead to famine if the harvest is bad. In years with good harvest the farmer may have surplus to sell to the local markets. The farms are small, about one to five hectares owned by the family. Application of machines is difficult as farms are small.'
 'The resulting population growth affects land use patterns. This may cause shortage of food and poor living standards. The solution to this problem is to improve small-scale crop cultivation. The government and other organisations should help farmers by providing them with education and capital to make subsistence agriculture more intensive and more productive. Moreover, the government, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and co-operative societies should help the farmers to select better seeds, use proper insecticides, pesticides, and apply fertilisers properly. In addition, they should help in providing transport to make sure the products reach proper storage places and markets. Furthermore, the government should emphasise and support the opening of joint agriculture ventures, finding of markets for surplus products and establishing good storage facilities. Additionally, deliberate efforts should be made to provide education on good farming practises, for example, the use of simple'
 'In both countries, dairy farming is practised where there is adequate water supply and plenty of pasture. Overall, the development of the livestock-keeping sector is important in both countries. Moreover, the two countries practise livestock at both the subsistence and commercial levels. The animals and their products can be used to meet family needs and sometimes be sold to raise revenue. In Tanzania, sedentary livestock-keeping is practised in densely populated areas and, hence, with a shortage of land such as the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro and the Southern Highlands whereas in Australia it is practised specifically in the South East of the country.'
 'Agriculture can be done by individual farmers, companies, or co-operative societies. Crop farming is the type of agriculture that involves the cultivation of land to produce crops.

 '### Methods of mining  \nMethods of mining depend on the location of the mineral in the earth’s crust. There are four methods of mining which are surface, underground, alluvial, and in-situ mining.'
 'There are two main types of mining, namely, surface and underground mining. Minerals such as salts are found close to the earth surface; as such, open cast method of mining is used to exploit them. Other minerals like gold and diamond are found deep in the ground, hence undergound mining methods are used to obtain them.  \nThe world is full of different types of minerals. Minerals can be classified into five main groups, that is, rocks used as building stones, and for brick making; non-metallic minerals such as salt, sulphur, nitrates, and asbestos; metals like gold, iron, and silver; mineral fuels including coal, petroleum and gas; and water. The whole of the earth, therefore, is full of minerals which are of great value to human beings.'
 'Surface mining is done by removing (stripping) surface vegetation, dirt, and, if necessary, layers of bedrock in order to reach buried ore deposits.

46,"Hello, pls give me true or false question for cultivation techniques of sisal for my students homework",True or False: The recommended depth for ploughing the land before planting sisal is 30 cm.,"['### Sisal  \nSisal is a tropical plant whose leaves produce strong threads (fibres) which are used for various purposes such as rope and carpet making. Sisal was originally grown in southern Mexico. Subsequently, it has been widely cultivated in many other countries. In fact, it has widely been introduced in the tropics and subtropics. In Tanzania, sisal was introduced in 1893 by Dr Richard Hindorf and the first 62 sisal plants were planted near Pangani in Tanga Region. Until the 1960s, Tanzania was the leading producer of sisal, but since then Brazil has become the major world producer of sisal, followed by Tanzania, Kenya, Madagascar and China. In Tanzania, sisal is grown in Tanga, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Morogoro, Lindi and Mtwara regions.  \nFigure 2.7 Sisal farm in Tanga  \nSource: https://www.ippmedia.com/en/news/strategising-restore-sisal-cash-crop-day'
 '#### Farm preparation, planting and caring of sisal:  \nIt is recommended that land should be well-prepared by ploughing to a depth of 30 cm before planting.'
 '#### Harvesting, processing and transportation of sisal:  \nHarvesting of sisal begins when the colour of thorns at the tips changes from dark brown to light-brown. The processing of leaves should take place 48 hours after being harvested. Through processing, sisal fibres are obtained whereby the leaves are crushed between rollers and then mechanically scraped. Then the fibres are washed and dried. Drying of fibres is done in the sun or by using drying machines. This is followed by brushing of the dried fibres for straightening as well as polishing. Thereafter, the fibres are graded depending on their length and colour. It is important to ensure cleanliness of the bale. Graded fibres are then packed into bales either manually or by using machines.'
 '#### Uses of sisal:  \nSisal is used to make ropes, buffing cloth, mattresses, carpets, handicraft mats, and baskets. Sisal is commonly used in the shipping industry for mooring small craft, lashing, and handling cargo. It is also used in the automobile industry with fiber glass in composite materials. Other products developed from sisal fibre include lumbar support belts, rugs, slippers, clothes and disc buffers. Farmers also use sisal fibre for tomato plant support and ropes for reinforcement of ceiling corners. Waste from sisal extraction can be used for making biogas, pharmaceutical ingredients and building materials. Fibres can also be used as fertiliser or animal feed.'
 '#### Conditions for growing sisal:  \nSisal growing needs high temperatures ranging between 25°C and 30°C. It also needs slight rainfall ranging from 650 mm to 1,500 mm. It is grown in well-drained loamy soil. This type of soil contains a lot of decayed vegetable matter with little amounts of sand and clay. Rainfall plays an important role as far as fibre production is concerned. On the whole, sisal does not need too much rainfall and cannot tolerate frosty conditions.'

47,"hi, can you prepare a long-answer question about Conservation of biodiversity that requires students to explain deeply","Explain the impact of large-scale mining on biodiversity, using specific examples to support your answer.","['- Deforestation and loss of biodiversity: Large-scale mining involves clearing of forests and any other vegetation cover. The clearance of vegetation causes the loss of different plant and animal species. Mining causes direct and indirect damage to wild animals by altering their habitats. This may lead to the disappearance of various wildlife species such as birds and other animals.\n- Loss of soil productivity: Rocky soils left behind after mining cannot support crop production because they have low fertility. In fact, the soil structure and texture is destroyed when it mixes with particles of rocks.\n- Effects on the water table: Deep mining that reaches the water table may cause underground water to flood the mines. As a result, the water has to be pumped out to allow mining to continue. Continued pumping of this underground water lowers the water table of the area.'
 '#### Protecting the biodiversity:  \nMore than 17 percent of the land area in Namibia is protected. The large number of parks and protected areas with flourishing wildlife populations is a significant ongoing attraction for international and domestic visitors.'

48,"Hi, can you provide a short-answer question about strategies to enhance transportation in Tanzania for my classwork?",How can Tanzania enhance its transportation system according to the measures to address transport challenges in the country?,"['### Measures to address transport challenges in Tanzania:  \nTanzania needs to take several initiatives in a bid to address the transport challenges facing the country. Such initiatives should focus on policy, strategy, resource mobilisation and capacity-building. The initiatives aim at translating policies and strategies into action. The following sections present some of the measures aimed to address the identified challenges.  \n- National policies and sub-regional and regional agreements: Tanzania has to demonstrate its commitment in improving the domestic investment environment by taking necessary steps. The actions need to target full liberalisation of the transport sector to attract investors, and strengthening the regulatory and enforcement mechanisms. In addition, improving co-ordination in developing and implementing regional and sub-regional agreements on transport facilitation and air transport liberalisation should be seriously considered.'
 '- Improved transport and communication network: Well-developed transport and communication in Japan and Korea play a big role in the development of industries as the transportation of raw materials tends to be easy and at low costs. Similar conditions should be created to increase productivity in Tanzania’s industries.\n- Investment in research: Both Japan and Korea have heavily invested in research and development particularly on better, efficient, and effective production methods. This has continually improved their production methods and made the costs manageable. Therefore, Tanzania needs to invest in research.\n- Training and development of workers: Japan and Korea have been allocating adequate funds for training to enhance workers’ productivity. This is something that Tanzania should also do to improve the industrial sector.'
 'There are several ways to improve large-scale crop cultivation in Tanzania. Improvement of the transport network and communication systems will facilitate the transportation of farm inputs to the farm and agricultural products to industrial centers and markets. The government should also render the necessary support to prop up large-scale farming by providing subsidies in addition to creating a conducive investment climate by reducing the heavy and number of taxes on agricultural facilities. Moreover, there is also a need to establish and expand irrigation schemes through public and private partnerships. Furthermore, farmers should be empowered through the establishment of co-operative banks for loan provision and sustainable markets. There is also a need to enforce a mechanism aimed to ensure extension officers work in the field with farmers where they can provide technical assistance on the selection of seeds, use of fertilisers and pesticides, and processing and packaging of crops.'
 '## Chapter Nine (Transport)  \n### Introduction  \nIn this chapter, you will learn about types of transport systems used in different parts of the world, including East Africa, the importance of transport in Tanzania and East Africa; and the problems facing transportation in East Africa.

 'Improvement of infrastructure: In making energy more accessible to all, infrastructure should be improved. Inland roads in remote areas should be rehabilitated to easen transportation of poles for the supply of electricity. Pipeline networks for natural gas distribution should also be built in various parts of the country for electricity generation.  \nCommunity awareness creation: The society should be educated on the need to conserve the environment by using environmentally-friendly sources of power.  \nEnvironmental conservation campaign: Various campaigns towards environmental conservation have been launched in Tanzania. Examples include the Mama Misitu campaign which was launched in Tanzania. This five-year (2011 - 2016) campaign aimed to improve community based forest governance. When forests are protected there would be less erosion and, hence, less siltation.'

49,"Hi, can you help me with a question where students need to explain challenges faced in river basin projects?",Explain three challenges faced in river basin projects according to the context provided.,"['#### Challenges facing river basin projects  \nRiver basin projects face numerous challenges. Many of these challenges are caused by natural events and human activitiesthattakeplaceinthebasins. These are described below.  \n##### Siltation  \nSiltation is one of the challenges facing river basin projects. The water in dams depends on the supply of water from highland areas through streams and rivers. Usually streams flowing into dams carry some sediments which ultimately accumulate in the dams. This accumulation of sediments leads to a decrease in the volume of water which may have numerous impacts. These impacts may include lowering the ability of dams to produce enough water necessary for electricity generation, in addition to affecting transport and destroying marine organisms.  \n##### Water pollution'
 '## Chapter Three (Water management for economic development)  \n### Introduction  \nIn this chapter, you will learn about the uses and economic importance of water; the relationship between family size, water supply, and the quality of life; the relationship between vegetation and water supply; and the effects of distance to water sources from households to a girl child in Tanzania. You will also learn about river basin development, requirements for establishing a river basin project, as well as benefits and challenges facing river basin projects. Finally, you will learn about land reclamation, underground water, aquatic resources, pollution, and water conservation.'
 '#### Requirements for establishing a river basin project  \nAs river basin projects serve social and economic purposes, they need to be carefully designed by observing a number of issues. The following are some of the requirements which should be observed when establishing a river basin project:  \n- Construction of dams for retaining water.\n- Removal of silt or mud from the river or dam (dredging).\n- For transport purposes, the river channels should be straightened and widened so that they can accommodate more water.\n- Trees should be planted on marginal land, hill slopes, and riverbanks. This will help to control soil erosion and check the movement of surface run-off, to reduce or prevent silting and flooding.  \nIf such requirements are observed, river basin projects will achieve the expected benefits.'
 '##### Water pollution  \nWater pollution is another challenge related to the dam projects. In many cases, modern agriculture involves the use of agro-chemicals. These agro- chemicals dissolve in water and get transported to the dams through water streams which may affect marine organisms, including fish.  \n##### Costs  \nGenerally, the establishment and maintenance of river basin projects is costly. The cost may be higher particularly when the basins encounter unexpected natural events such as droughts or excessive rainfall. Whereas droughts reduce the volume of water in dams, excessive rainfall may lead to overflow and too much siltation in the dams. The overflow damages property and farms in outlining areas.  \n##### Trans-boundary conflicts'
 'River basin development also attracts irrigation. Due to the availability of water in a basin, commercial agriculture is established through irrigation schemes. Sometimes, individual peasants use a well-managed river basin for watering their small farms using traditional mechanisms such as buckets. In addition, river basin development projects involve planting of trees and construction of dams. They also involve strict measures for prohibiting deforestation and poor cultivation practises. All these measures aim to foster appropriate use of the land to keep it productive. These measures also enable the preservation of the ecosystem. By doing so, these projects contribute to preventing the land from being eroded by environmental problems such as soil erosion, floods and loss of soil fertility.'
