Identify two challenges that river basin projects often face as described in the textbook.,"#### Requirements for establishing a river basin project  
As river basin projects serve social and economic purposes, they need to be carefully designed by observing a number of issues. The following are some of the requirements which should be observed when establishing a river basin project:  
- Construction of dams for retaining water.
- Removal of silt or mud from the river or dam (dredging).
- For transport purposes, the river channels should be straightened and widened so that they can accommodate more water.
- Trees should be planted on marginal land, hill slopes, and riverbanks. This will help to control soil erosion and check the movement of surface run-off, to reduce or prevent silting and flooding.

True or False: Rice seedlings should be transplanted when they are at least 30 days old.,"##### Conditions for growing rice:  
Rice is a tropical crop which grows well where the average temperature during the growing season is between 20°C and 27°C. Abundant sunshine is also essential during its four months of growth. The minimum temperature should not go below 15°C as germination cannot take place below that temperature. Rice requires more water than any other crop. As a result, paddy cultivation is done only in those areas where minimum rainfall is 1,150 mm. Paddy also needs flooded conditions with the depth of water varying over 25 mm at the time of transplanting to as much as 150 mm for 10 weeks of the growing period.

Automatic irrigation and agricultural machinery require fossil fuels and other sources of energy to run them. The increase in the price of fossil fuel, therefore, increases the cost of production. At times, there is a shortage of water as irrigation requires a lot of water. The amount of underground water drawn for irrigation is increasing whereas the amount of water to refill is decreasing; which results in shortage of water for agricultural use. Another problem has to do with loss of soil fertility as the soil is eroded faster than it can be replenished due to over- cultivation. Also, over-irrigation causes leaching of soil nutrients.",tensor(0.3833),tensor(0.5628),tensor(0.4549),Mention five major challenges facing large-scale agriculture in the USA.,tensor(0.8793),tensor(0.8407),tensor(0.8589)

Describe the process of fermenting plucked tea leaves as mentioned in the textbook and explain its importance in tea processing.,"#### Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation of tea:  
It takes two years for tea plants to be ready for harvesting. Picking of tea leaves requires experience because if it is done poorly, it may result in low-quality tea. Tea plants are normally plucked for 3-4 years after which all old branches are pruned for new shoots to grow. The plucked tea leaves undergo fermentation under regulated moisture to ensure quality tea product. Thereafter, tea leaves are rolled to enhance the breakup of the leaf cells and fibres. The leaves are then dried in temperatures of about 105°C. This process is called roasting or firing. Roasting stops fermentation and reduces moisture. Cool and dried tea is sorted in different sizes and graded. Unwanted particles are removed before packing. At this stage, tea is ready for consumption and export.

The rapid population growth puts more pressure on small-scale farmers. Yet, subsistence farmers are not likely to raise their output to feed the growing numbers because of lack of capital. Subsequently, land becomes overpopulated and resources overused. Also high population growth is associated with smaller farms and lower farm wages. As a result households in densely populated areas increasingly rely on off-farm income.",tensor(0.4717),tensor(0.6368),tensor(0.5416),Mention the effects of rapid population growth on small-scale crop cultivation.,tensor(0.7371),tensor(0.6454),tensor(0.6882)

Moreover, using better methods of agriculture such as contour ploughing, terracing, and strip farming especially in steep slopes helps to prevent erosion.  
(c) Land may also be reclaimed by restoring its fertility. In this case, land which has lost fertility may require planting cover crops and addition of organic manure and fertilisers to improve its fertility. The fertility will attract vegetation growth. Vegetation will not only bind the soil but also protect it from excessive loss of water through transpiration.  
(d) Land affected by excessive animal keeping can be restored by reducing the number of animals in the area. This simple reclamation method allows the land to be proportionally used.",tensor(0.4939),tensor(0.5932),tensor(0.5383),"Transpiration is...

Over-exploitation of forest resources is one of the challenges. Forest resources are harvested to the point of reducing their ability to regenerate. For example, some forest tree species, especially natural trees, are usually in high demand. The demand compels over-harvesting of such forest resources so much so that they face extinction. In some cases, forests are harvested without following governing procedures and, consequently, some tree species may disappear. Experience indicates that ungoverned exploitation is usually serious in public-owned natural forests than in private planted forests.

Large-scale crop cultivation is characterized by cultivation of a large area with the application of high level of technology. The technology involves the use of tractors, combine harvesters, and processing machines. As large-scale farming is highly mechanized, it employs few skilled people because machines carry out agricultural activities that otherwise could have been done manually by humans.  
In addition, such commercial farming is capital-intensive to support the production. Also, it is often based on a single crop, a practise known as monoculture. Chemical fertilisers are highly used to maximise yields. Large-scale agriculture is basically a source of raw materials for different manufacturing industries.

Discuss the ecological and social implications of nomadic pastoralism as described in the characteristics and disadvantages of the practice. What measures could be adopted to mitigate these challenges while preserving the traditional lifestyle of the nomadic pastoralists?,"#### Characteristics of nomadic pastoralism:  
The nomads normally move in groups. These groups are formed through the integration of families or members of a given ethnic group. A group involves a chief or elders who make decisions for the entire group. Indeed, large herd tends to cause overgrazing. Overgrazing is a situation where the number of cattle is greater than the carrying capacity of the grazing land. As a result, overgrazing causes soil erosion, land degradation, and loss of valuable species. Another feature of the nomadic pastoralists is the breeding process, which is uncontrolled. This situation may lead to the spread and outbreak of animal diseases, hence low animal quality and deaths.  
In addition, there is poor control of pests and other diseases, which result to poor quality of animal products. Furthermore, nomadic pastoralism takes place where the population is scarce as the animals are grazed in open range, which needs a lot of space.",tensor(0.4767),tensor(0.5172),tensor(0.4903),Explain what nomadic pastoralism means.,tensor(0.5283),tensor(0.4333),tensor(0.4684)

Alternative sources of power: Alternative sources of power to support the existing sources should be explored to meet the increasing power demand in Tanzania. By 2013, the annual power demand increase was between 10 percent and 15 percent. The demand for power and energy is expected to increase because of the new industries that are to be constructed.  
Funds allocation for exploration: The government is required to allocate adequate funds for exploring other sources of power. Tanzania is endowed with many power and energy sources, which have not been yet harnessed due to lack of capital.

"Describe in detail the process of tea harvesting and post-harvest processing as practiced in Tanzania, including the techniques used in fermentation, rolling, drying, and sorting of the tea leaves.","#### Harvesting, processing, storage and transportation of tea:  
It takes two years for tea plants to be ready for harvesting. Picking of tea leaves requires experience because if it is done poorly, it may result in low-quality tea. Tea plants are normally plucked for 3-4 years after which all old branches are pruned for new shoots to grow. The plucked tea leaves undergo fermentation under regulated moisture to ensure quality tea product. Thereafter, tea leaves are rolled to enhance the breakup of the leaf cells and fibres. The leaves are then dried in temperatures of about 105°C. This process is called roasting or firing. Roasting stops fermentation and reduces moisture. Cool and dried tea is sorted in different sizes and graded. Unwanted particles are removed before packing. At this stage, tea is ready for consumption and export. Figure 2.6 shows the plucking of tea leaves in Iringa.

Explain how the lack of processing and storage facilities in nomadic pastoralism leads to significant losses of products.,"#### Disadvantages of nomadic pastoralism:  
Nomadic pastoralism suffers from lack of processing and storage facilities, hence causing a significant loss of the products. Also, over-grazing under nomadic pastoralism leads to soil erosion. Moreover, the control of diseases is difficult since animals are always on the move, which can affect the health of the animals and lower productivity in the process. For example, there have been cases of loss of large numbers of livestock due to lack of water and pasture. This situation affects the economy of the pastoralists. Furthermore, the practise of nomadic pastoralism tends to cause conflicts as they interfere with crop cultivators’ land. Because of their nomadic nature, many of the pastoralists’ children fail to attend formal education. As such, their periodic movements result in many of these children being denied their right to education and associated opportunities.",tensor(0.4559),tensor(0.6109),tensor(0.5217),Explain what nomadic pastoralism means.,tensor(0.5697),tensor(0.4819),tensor(0.5123)

Moreover, using better methods of agriculture such as contour ploughing, terracing, and strip farming especially in steep slopes helps to prevent erosion.  
(c) Land may also be reclaimed by restoring its fertility. In this case, land which has lost fertility may require planting cover crops and addition of organic manure and fertilisers to improve its fertility. The fertility will attract vegetation growth. Vegetation will not only bind the soil but also protect it from excessive loss of water through transpiration.

Large-scale farming requires a large capital investment to buy machinery and farm inputs, prepare land and pay farm labourers. It also relies on seasonal rainfall. Climatic changes have largely affected the amount of rainfall in many areas of Tanzania. Since the majority of large-scale farmers in Tanzania rely on rain-fed agriculture, whenever there is a shortage of rainfall, agricultural production falls. Agricultural products from large-scale crop cultivation in Tanzania such as tea, sisal and coffee face stiff competition from other countries that produce the same crops. As a result, prices of such products tend to be low. In addition, large-scale crop cultivation in Tanzania has to contend with pests and diseases.

The nomads normally move in groups. These groups are formed through the integration of families or members of a given ethnic group. A group involves a chief or elders who make decisions for the entire group. Indeed, large herd tends to cause overgrazing. Overgrazing is a situation where the number of cattle is greater than the carrying capacity of the grazing land. As a result, overgrazing causes soil erosion, land degradation, and loss of valuable species. Another feature of the nomadic pastoralists is the breeding process, which is uncontrolled. This situation may lead to the spread and outbreak of animal diseases, hence low animal quality and deaths.

Discuss the importance of biodiversity conservation and explain the measures taken to protect biodiversity in Namibia and Tanzania. Include the impact that conservation efforts have on tourism and the local communities in your answer.,"- Deforestation and loss of biodiversity: Large-scale mining involves clearing of forests and any other vegetation cover. The clearance of vegetation causes the loss of different plant and animal species. Mining causes direct and indirect damage to wild animals by altering their habitats. This may lead to the disappearance of various wildlife species such as birds and other animals.
- Loss of soil productivity: Rocky soils left behind after mining cannot support crop production because they have low fertility. In fact, the soil structure and texture is destroyed when it mixes with particles of rocks.
- Effects on the water table: Deep mining that reaches the water table may cause underground water to flood the mines. As a result, the water has to be pumped out to allow mining to continue. Continued pumping of this underground water lowers the water table of the area.",tensor(0.4635),tensor(0.5069),tensor(0.4828),Explain the role of mass media in forest conservation.,tensor(0.5256),tensor(0.4840),tensor(0.5034)
Describe how improving regional and sub-regional agreements on transport facilitation could enhance transportation in Tanzania.,"### Measures to address transport challenges in Tanzania:  
Tanzania needs to take several initiatives in a bid to address the transport challenges facing the country. Such initiatives should focus on policy, strategy, resource mobilisation and capacity-building. The initiatives aim at translating policies and strategies into action. The following sections present some of the measures aimed to address the identified challenges.  
- National policies and sub-regional and regional agreements: Tanzania has to demonstrate its commitment in improving the domestic investment environment by taking necessary steps. The actions need to target full liberalisation of the transport sector to attract investors, and strengthening the regulatory and enforcement mechanisms. In addition, improving co-ordination in developing and implementing regional and sub-regional agreements on transport facilitation and air transport liberalisation should be seriously considered.",tensor(0.4438),tensor(0.5792),tensor(0.5012),Suggest what should be done to address the challenges facing the transport sector in Tanzania.,tensor(0.6512),tensor(0.5459),tensor(0.5936)
"Explain the challenges faced by river basin projects, particularly focusing on siltation and water pollution.","#### Challenges facing river basin projects  
River basin projects face numerous challenges. Many of these challenges are caused by natural events and human activitiesthattakeplaceinthebasins. These are described below.  
##### Siltation  
Siltation is one of the challenges facing river basin projects. The water in dams depends on the supply of water from highland areas through streams and rivers. Usually streams flowing into dams carry some sediments which ultimately accumulate in the dams. This accumulation of sediments leads to a decrease in the volume of water which may have numerous impacts. These impacts may include lowering the ability of dams to produce enough water necessary for electricity generation, in addition to affecting transport and destroying marine organisms.
